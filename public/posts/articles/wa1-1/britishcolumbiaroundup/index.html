Rob wrote, “My wife and I noticed something odd as we sat on our sundeck on the evening of 5 July 2004. We’d put up three hummingbird feeders in early May and have enjoyed large numbers of the little birds voraciously feeding ever since, especially at dusk. One very small bird perched motionless at the feeder into the night. On close inspection he had what appeared to be a round growth at mid-beak. He was still there at 2300 h and I thought he’d died - he didn’t move when I stepped up and gently touched his tail feathers. So, rather than leave it until morning, I decided to remove the carcass. I gently pried him from the feeding perch, holding him between the folds of a paper towel. Being not quite sure what to do next, I headed to the kitchen. A tiny “peep” came from the towel so I quickly laid him out on the stove to see what the problem was. He had driven his beak through a hard shiny black seed the size of a peppercorn. Obviously when he tried to drink at the feeder the seed was pushed further up the beak by the feeder’s grid. I found a pair of very small cuticle scissors and with Cheryl holding a large flashlight on the patient, spent a nerve-wracking twenty-five minutes trying to cut the seed off its beak. He’d lash out with his beak in apparent pain when I tried to grasp the seed with a pair of tweezers. I almost gave up a few times in fear of cutting his beak through. Finally, after breaking into the seed, I was able to carefully cut it free without damage. I put down a small bottle cap of sugar water and set him outside for the night. The next morning he’d not moved. I realized I’d likely glued his talons to the towel with dried sugar water so I wetted the paper and he immediately flew into a nearby tree. A couple of minutes later he flew back to the feeder with unencumbered beak, perched there and drank for the better part of an hour before flying away. I haven’t seen my new buddy “Thumbtack” since but have no doubt he’s getting his strength back and doing well, and has a new respect for shiny black seeds.”\nIn his e-mail Rob also notes “I hope I never need to perform the procedure again – I’m not cut out for ER trauma.”\nNorthern Shrike Predation\nOn 26 March 20904 at Johnson’s Landing, at the north end of Kootenay Lake, Gail Spitler watched some “nature in the raw” events. A Northern Shrike (Lanius excubitor) suddenly stormed into the midst of a dozen ground-feeding Dark-eyed Juncos (Junco hyemalis). It caught one, stabbed its head with its beak a few times and held it tight in its talons. The shrike then flew up to a low branch in a chestnut shrub, about a foot off the ground, and draped the dead junco over the branch. It then commenced pecking and eating the head. A Steller’s Jay (Cyanocitta stelleri) approached, landed in the same shrub and seemed to be trying to get a morsel of junco as well. The shrike soon had had enough jay intrusion and grabbed the headless carcass in its talons and flew off. This all happened within 10 feet of her kitchen window, which gave great views of the shrike and the unfolding drama.\nFrom the WDC databases and library: The winter distribution of the Northern Shrike in British Columbia has changed dramatically over the past 25 years from a more rural to a human-dominated environment. Urban, residential, and built up rural areas, with well-maintained bird feeders, have attracted over-wintering individuals. At one location near Radium, the same Northern Shrike, identified by its incomplete facial mask, spent three full winters feeding on small songbirds at a group of feeders. At that site, prey size ranged from Common Redpolls (Carduelis flammea) to Evening Grosbeaks (Coccothraustes vespertinus).\nOsprey Stewardship\nOspreys (Pandion haliaetus) build large stick nests and it is not uncommon to see orange bailing twine adorning nests built close to agricultural areas. In the Creston Valley, young Ospreys have been found dead, dangling from the nest, after becoming entangled in the twine. Cyril Colonel, a local farmer, decided he would take a pro-active approach to the problem. He designed a poster to illustrate his concern and gave presentations to the local riding club, 4H Club, and the agricultural society. He also wrote a letter to the manufacturer of the twine listing his concerns. Cyril initiated an active volunteer program to pick up twine left lying around farmyards, horse corrals, and pastures throughout the Creston Valley. Discarded bailing twine can also potentially impact domestic animals, such as young calves, that can choke to death from ingesting the material. Damage to farm machinery may cost thousands of dollars in repairs.\nRick Howie, who monitors Osprey nests in the Kamloops area, also found that bailing twine was a factor in nestling mortality. On one occasion, he approached BC Hydro who immediately sent out a bucket truck to lift Rick up to a nest where twine was cut from a young Osprey’s foot. After discussions with ranchers Rick learned that some pick up the twine while others do not. Most ranchers were not aware of the problem with nesting Ospreys.\nBy addressing conservation concerns through informative posters and talking to landowners and farming groups, Cyril and Rick are making a difference in the lives of Ospreys.\nTracking a Rare Photo\nThe photograph in question had already been taken, but who had it, and where it was, was an entirely different issue. The image in question was that of a Crested Auklet (Aethia cristatella) that was present for several weeks off the coast of Rocky Point and Race Rocks in autumn 2003. News of the bird spread quickly through internet groups, but precisely who spotted the bird first was difficult to determine.\nThis information was important for two reasons: 1) I [Michael I. Preston] needed detailed information for the databases and a photograph for the BC Photo File, and 2) by the end of October 2003 it was clear that this bird, and the observers that first saw it, were going to receive The Wild Bird Trust of British Columbia’s “Critter of the Year Award”.\nThrough the various e-mails that had circulated, the best I could figure is that Amelie Rousseau had seen the bird first. The name was not one that we were familiar with, and thus the tracking began. I started by searching the Victoria and Area White Pages - surely any person working at the banding station would be living nearby. Flipping through the pages, ahh, there it is - 8 entries for Rousseau, and one for Amelie - mission accomplished.\nIt took several days to reach Amelie as it appeared she wasn’t home most of the time - probably out banding birds or something of the sort. Finally, on the fifth attempt, contact was made. I was delighted to hear her voice, and even more delighted to tell her that she had found the 2003 “Critter of the Year”. Unfortunately, she had no idea what I was talking about. She was not a bird bander, or even a birdwatcher. Even worse, she didn’t know anyone who was a birdwatcher!\nSo now what? Well maybe her name is not listed, or perhaps she’s married and it’s under her husband’s name. Starting from the top of the remaining listings I proceeded to call each one. The fifth listing was a gentleman, living quite some distance from the address for Amelie. When he answered the phone I asked for Amelie. He replied saying, “she doesn’t live here, she lives next door”. Bingo! He didn’t want to give me her phone number, and understandably so. Instead, he agreed to go over, inform Amelie of what was happening, and then call me back. And sure enough, five minutes later he did. He said “Amelie informed me that you just called her”. Turns out, she had moved and the phone book listing was incorrect. Back to square one.\nThe next step was to call local birders in Victoria, but again, I was unable to get any new information. Finally, I decided to call Chris Charlesworth. Afterall, he’s an active member of the e-groups and is the “Rare Bird Alert” operator for the Okanagan. Surely he’s heard something of this bird and its mystery observer.\nI called Chris in Kelowna and asked if he knew Amelie Rousseau. He did. She was the partner of Jukka Jantunen, a bander who once worked at MacKenzie with Vi and John Lambie, but had since taken the position at Rocky Point. I asked Chris if he had any contact information, but he didn’t. I used the Telus White Pages on-line to search out his name, and sure enough, there it was in Gibsons.\nI called the number and Amelie answered - Jukka was away on vacation. I explained everything, and she was delighted to hear that she and Jukka were the recipients of the award. Amelie was also more than happy to pass on three digital photos for the BC Photo File (Figure 3).\nNews of Friends\nFred L. Bunnell: After 34 years of teaching, supervising over 60 graduate students (mostly PhDs), and conducting research in the Faculty of Forestry, and later with the Centre for Applied Conservation Biology, Fred retired from the University of British Columbia on 30 June 2003. He is presently a Director of the Biodiversity Centre for Wildlife Studies.\nGary S. Davidson: In May 2003, Gary was presented with the Federation of British Columbia Naturalists “Club Recognition Award” for his work with the Arrow Lakes Naturalist Club. In January 2004 Gary and his wife flew to Tasmania where he will spend a year as an exchange teacher. Although the teaching load has been greater than expected he is looking forward to August when Chris Siddle and his wife will visit.\nAlton S. Harestad: Alton was promoted to full professor in the Department of Biological Sciences at Simon Fraser University in September 2003. On 15 April 2004 he was appointed Director of the Environmental Sciences Program at Simon Fraser University.\nRichard R. Howie: On 31 March 2004 Rick formally retired from his position as a habitat biologist for the Kamloops region with the British Columbia Ministry of Water, Land and Air Protection.\nDoug Janz: Doug officially retired as Department Head of the Wildlife Section with the British Columbia Ministry of Water, Land and Air Protection in Nanaimo on 31 March 2004.\nVi and John Lambie: Vi and John received the “Conservation and Education Award” from The Wild Bird Trust of British Columbia at their annual general meeting in November 2003. The award “Recognizes individuals for major contributions to the understanding, appreciation and protection of all wildlife and their specific habitats in British Columbia.”\nMichael I. Preston: In September 2003 Mike was accepted into a M.Sc. program in the Department of Biological Sciences at Simon Fraser University. Dr. Alton S. Harestad, his supervisor, is supporting his research on bird communities in clearcuts, group retention, and old-growth coastal forests on Vancouver Island. He recently presented three posters on his research in Ellensberg, WA (77th Annual Meeting of the Northwest Scientific Association) and Nanaimo, BC (Variable Retention Science Forum).\nAmber Robinson: As an undergraduate student at the University of Victoria, Amber volunteered and was later on staff at the Wildlife Data Centre entering data. She analyzed WDC data for two university projects in Geography. In September 2003, she was accepted for a M.Sc. program at the University of Manitoba. Dr. Spencer G. Sealy, her supervisor, was impressed with the amount and quality of information in the WDC databases and decided to encourage Amber to study Brown-headed Cowbird/songbird relationships.\nLinda M. Van Damme: Linda (Figure 4) received the “President’s Award” from The Wild Bird Trust of British Columbia at their annual general meeting in November, 2003.

Harestad, his supervisor, is supporting his research on bird communities in clearcuts, group retention, and old-growth coastal forests on Vancouver Island. He recently presented three posters on his research in Ellensberg, WA (77th Annual Meeting of the Northwest Scientific Association) and Nanaimo, BC (Variable Retention Science Forum).</p><p><strong>Amber Robinson:</strong> As an undergraduate student at the University of Victoria, Amber volunteered and was later on staff at the Wildlife Data Centre entering data. She analyzed WDC data for two university projects in Geography. In September 2003, she was accepted for a M.Sc. program at the University of Manitoba. Dr. Spencer G. Sealy, her supervisor, was impressed with the amount and quality of information in the WDC databases and decided to encourage Amber to study Brown-headed Cowbird/songbird relationships.</p><p><strong>Linda M.
