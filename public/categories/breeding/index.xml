The Semipalmated Plover (Charadrius semipalmatus) is a small, common and familiar shorebird identified by a single dark band across its breast. Unlike many of its relatives who feed and fly in large flocks, this tame sandpiper prefers to forage by itself, running a few steps, then darting to snatch some insect, isopod, or worm, before chasing after another morsel. It is a medium- to long-distant migrant and is best seen in spring and autumn where it feeds or rests on open muddy and sandy shores.</description>

The Upland Sandpiper (Bartramia longicauda) has always been a challenging species to find in British Columbia. At the time of Munro and Cowan (1947) it was known from only nine localities, all but one from the interior of the province. Over the next 43 years the number of localities increased to 47 with many showing up along the coast including Vancouver Island and the Queen Charlotte Islands (Campbell et al.</description>

The Dusky Flycatcher (Empidonax oberholseri) is widely distributed throughout the central interior of British Columbia south of the Bulkley Basin near Smithers and the Fraser-Nechako region near Prince George (Campbell et al. 1997). It is considered a vagrant along the coast and locally rare in the northern interior of the province. Phinney (1998) lists a single record for the Dawson Creek area. There are an additional 10 widely scattered records for the remainder of the northern interior over the past 117 years.</description>
