Welcome to Wildlife Afield, the bi-annual journal of the Biodiversity Centre for Wildlife Studies. 

After years of hard work and a few stumbling blocks along the way, I am very excited to announce that the Biodiversity Centre for Wildlife Studies (BCWS), a non-profit society and charitable organization, is now the new and permanent host of British Columbia's Wildlife Data Centre. In the coming years, the BCWS will lead the way in wildlife data storage, archiving, and preservation, while providing a valuable information service to naturalists, land managers, biologists, field researchers, students and teachers, consultants, and the public. A brief outline of how we intend to achieve these goals is provided in this first issue in the *Report of the Wildlife Data Centre*. A more complete business plan will be published seperately in early 2005.

*Wildlife Afield* is a journal with four main objectives: 1) to present the results of original and previously unpublished field research in British Columbia in the *Feature Article* section; 2) to present a summary of original and previously unpublished natural history events based on field observations in British Columbia in the *Notes* section; 3) to provide readers with species' profiles, progress reports, and information exchanges that originate at the Wildlife Data Centre in the *Wildlife Data Centre* section; and 4) to provide in the *British Columbia Round-Up* section, personal stories, news of upcoming meetings and events, book reviews, and other topics or issues that pertain to wildlife and people in British Columbia.

With the launch of our first issue I am pleased to notify all potential contributors that articles, notes, and news or information segments, are now being accepted for consideration for future issues of *Wildlife Afield*. Authors can submit original manuscripts by following the *Instructions for Authors* on the inside back cover of this issue. *Feature Articles* will be peer-reviewed by at least one member of the BCWS Editorial Board, and by an Editor of *Wildlife Afield*.

We hope you enjoy reading this issue and help support the objectives of the BCWS and the publication of *Wildlife Afield*. For the first time in our history, we are going to be in a position to provide information based on data for proactive wildlife conservation in British Columbia. Let's do this together. Please support the vision.

*Michael I. Preston*
