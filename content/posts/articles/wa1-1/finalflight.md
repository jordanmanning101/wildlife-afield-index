**J.E. Victor Goodwill** (1916-2004): Vic passed away at his home in Victoria on 20 February 2004. 

Vic received a B.Sc. degree in mining engineering from the University of Toronto in 1938. He worked as a hydrographer on the St. Lawrence River in Quebec, Bras d’Or Lake in Nova Scotia, Souris Harbour in Prince Edward Island, Miramichi Bay in New Brunswick and Hopedale, Labrador for 18 years after graduation. He soon learned that his passion for birds and hydrographic surveying were made for each other and Vic began contributing bird records to W. Earl Godfrey for his book Birds of Canada and R.W. Tufts for Birds of Nova Scotia. With birding in mind he secured a transfer to the West Coast in 1966 and began exploring British Columbia from the seaside of land. His diaries today are still the most complete set of wildlife notes for coastal areas of the province. 

Vic, with his wife Peggy, were very involved in birding activities on southern Vancouver Island and for many years operated the “Rare Bird Alert” for the Victoria Natural History Society. He also served as subregional editor and compiler for quarterly reports from southern Vancouver Island that was published in American Birds. He graciously participated in many local and provincial projects involving birds and was a major contributor to the 4-volume set of The Birds of British Columbia. His field notes (Figure 7), the most meticulous and detailed in British Columbia, fill a large 4-drawer filing cabinet. Along with an impressive library of scientific and natural history journals and books, Vic was set up with research material that helped fulfill his lifelong interest in birds. Vic’s birding collections of notes, books, journals, paintings, and optics have been donated to the Wildlife Data Centre in Victoria. 

Vic and Peggy received the WBT Wild Bird Trust of British Columbia “Conservation and Education Award “ in 2003 for their immense contributions to wildlife in the province.

**Doug Innes** (1925-2000): Doug passed away on 9 December 2000 in Victoria. 

He was born in Battleford, Saskatchewan on 27 December 1925 and later graduated from the University of British Columbia with a Bachelor of Education. During his career he taught at elementary schools in Langley, Vanderhoof, and Prince Rupert. He retired to Courtenay, on Vancouver Island, in 1985 where he could pursue his true passion of recording bird songs, photographing wildlife, and contributing to the vision of a centralized provincial repository for information on British Columbia wildlife. 

Doug could have been an ornithologist (Figure 8). He had the methodical approach of a scientist, the patience of a preacher, and the eagerness to unravel some of the mysteries of the private lives of birds. His research on the song dialects of Townsend’s Warblers (Dendroica townsendi) was beginning to show promise. He had already determined that there were at least five distinct sub-populations of these colourful warblers living on Vancouver Island each summer. One population migrated through Washington State and along the mainland coast of British Columbia to the northern end of the Strait of Georgia. Then they abruptly moved west and settled in the vicinity of Campbell/Brewster Lakes. Through sonogram readings Doug was also able to analyze individual songs of owls, especially Barred Owl (Strix varia), to determine the year-to-year presence and summer home range. This technique had direct applications for logging, mining, and other human activities on Vancouver Island. 

In 1998, Doug grew increasingly concerned about the loss of wildlife information from British Columbia to national and international databases. He withdrew from some volunteer projects and concentrated his efforts on unraveling the Townsend’s Warbler story along the coast. In the meantime, he continued to provide the Wildlife Data Centre (WDC) in Victoria with valuable information. Much of his personal collection has been given to the WDC where it will be available for study and used to protect birds and their habitats.

**Alexander (Allister) Muir** (1932-2003): Allister passed away in hospital in Mission, B.C. on 7 October 2003. 

Allister was born in Glasgow, Scotland on 28 September 1932 where he spent his childhood. After high school he worked in the Clydesdale Bank in Scotland between 1949 and 1955 that was interupted briefly between 1951 and 1953 by military service in England. 

Allister became interested in birding in 1948 while taking a high school science course in Great Britain. He travelled through Scotland, Wales and England enjoying his hobby and in August 1955 moved to Canada where he resided for the rest of his life. Allister travelled extensively throughout North America, with side trips to Great Britain, Hawaii, and New Zealand. He never went anywhere without his binoculars. His motto was “you never know when you will see something interesting.” 

He contributed annually to the BC Nest Record Scheme from its inception in 1956. Allister held a federal banding permit for six years and set up banding stations in West Vancouver and Burnaby. He also participated in many conservation and research projects including the Breeding Bird Survey, Winter Bird Count, Wood Duck Nest Box Project, Vancouver International Airport Raptor Trapping and Removal Program, and the University of British Columbia Marine Bird Census and Banding Program. As a bank manager Allister worked in many branches around the province including Vancouver, West Vancouver, Burnaby, Nanaimo, Walley, Duncan, Houston, Chilliwack, Victoria, Squamish, and Gibsons. During each work period he regularly provided new seasonal information for The Birds of British Columbia from little known areas of the province. He retired in 1988 and continued his support of the vision and activities of the Wildlife Data Centre. 

Additional biographical material appeared in the 47th Annual Report of the BC Nest Record Scheme.

**(Jack) Gilbert Sarles** (1908-2003): Jack passed away on 30 May 2003 at “the dawn chorus of the birds.” 

He was born in Trenton, Ontario on 5 August 1908. Jack’s love of the outdoors and zest for life led him to a broad range of interests that included research on his family tree, fly-fishing, photography, hiking, travelling, and bird studies. He saw a need for conservation and became deeply involved in activities and research that directly contributed to his interest in birdwatching. Along with William M. Hughes and Robert D. Harris, Jack was one of the early mentors for Wayne Campbell by supporting and encouraging his banding activities, conservation projects, birder’s nights, publications, and post-secondary schooling. 

Jack, and his wife Rosamond, organized the first census of Cliff Swallow (Petrochelidon pyrrhonota) colonies on the Lower Mainland and followed up their research analyzing soil texture in nests to determine the success and failure of individual colony sites. Jack was given an honourary Life Membership in the Vancouver Natural History Society and received the Kay Nye Award for his outstanding service to the Society and conservation in general. 

Much of Jack’s personal wildlife material has been donated to the Wildlife Data Centre in Victoria. Additional biographical material appeared in the 47th Annual Report of the British Columbia Nest Record Scheme.

**Thomas “Tommy” Sowerby** (1907-2004): Tommy was born in England on 19 April 1907 and came to Canada with his family at the age of seven. His working life included employment as a troubleshooter in the Alberta oilfields. Tommy was enlisted and at the end of WWII he furthered his education in the forestry field and later worked for the BC Forest Service in Victoria. While in Victoria he became fascinated with Sky Larks (Alauda arvensis) and began studying and photographing them. He later moved into the interior and settled for short periods in Balfour, Cranbrook, and Creston. Tommy enjoyed watching birds and regularly sent his records to Wayne Campbell for use in The Birds of British Columbia and his future projects. He also helped review the Birds of North America Sky Lark account.
