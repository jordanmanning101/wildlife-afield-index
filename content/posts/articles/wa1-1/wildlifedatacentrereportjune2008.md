*Michael I. Preston*

**Manager’s Message**

It’s interesting how ideas develop and evolve, and when I think about the Wildlife Data Centre and what has been accomplished so far, I’m reminded of a monumental event that took place 35 years ago. On 20 July 1969 Neil Armstrong was the first man to set foot on the moon. Did he do it alone? No. Did it go just as planned? No. Did the success pay off? Yes.

In 1996, Wayne Campbell had an idea - to establish the first regional wildlife data centre in British Columbia. The objectives were simple:

* To create and maintain a permanent central repository for all historical and current information on wildlife in British Columbia.

* To preserve information on British Columbia wildlife so that it is not lost to, or fragmented across, national, international, and provincial databases. 

* To provide summary information on wildlife and their habitats to a diverse audience for a range of conservation, management, and education applications. 

* To provide explicit data, on a per request basis, for developing conservation strategies, management plans, research projects, and publications. 

* To promote and establish working relationships with major stakeholders such as government agencies, industry, consultants, academic institutions, nongovernment organizations, media, and residents of British Columbia.

On 17 July 2002 Wayne and Eileen Campbell, along with Wild Bird Trust of British Columbia Directors, signed a data transfer agreement that initiated the renovation of 1181 Royal Oak Drive which would become the Data Centre. In mid-January 2004, after the resignation of WBT Directors Fred Bunnell and Wayne Campbell, the WBT executive board decided to close the Centre. Upon closing, the WBT Directors met once again with Wayne and Eileen, this time to return all that WBT had acquired for the Centre. For that we are thankful.

By the end of January 2004 the entire contents of 1181 Royal Oak Drive were boxed or disassembled and moved to three locations: Wayne and Eileen’s home, my home, and two storage lockers. In total, over 500 boxes containing 60,000+ pieces of literature, 9 computers, 10 desks, 6 filing cabinets, and numerous maps and paintings were packed and moved in just 5 days.

From February through June, Wayne, Fred, and myself, along with consultation with numerous long-term supporters of the Wildlife Data Centre, decided that moving ahead was the only logical solution. Much work needed to be done, but it was a task that had to be completed - and this time it had to be done right.

On 31 August 2004 the Biodiversity Centre for Wildlife Studies was registered as a provincial non-profit society (S-48037). The operation and success of the Wildlife Data Centre will be the first and foremost priority of the Society. But like landing on the moon, this cannot be achieved without good planning, determination, and financial support.

In the coming months we intend to: 1) develop an operational plan that defines our mandate, objectives, and purpose, and explain how these will be upheld or achieved; 2) develop a data-sharing agreement that allows the Wildlife Data Centre to use and share data collected by external participants; 3) develop a data license agreement that defines the terms and conditions of data use for “clients” of data housed by the Wildlife Data Centre; 4) develop and launch a website that will begin to update the status of British Columbia wildlife, as well as to provide information on conservation and management issues in the province; 5) establish a series of books, reports, checklists, research notes, and a new journal (Wildlife Afield; ISSN 1712-2880) as a means of providing information on British Columbia wildlife; and 6) find a new facility for the Wildlife Data Centre in Victoria.

I want to thank the hundreds of people who have helped us get this far, and more importantly to those who have trusted us. With this new society comes fresh thinking, innovation, and opportunity. There are a few who have doubted us and unfortunately feel the need to spread ill will, but I hope they will see that what we are trying to accomplish is not for personal gain, but for wildlife and people. In a recent search of our contributors over the past 50 years, I was perhaps most interested in the fact that the individuals doing the most complaining are those who have contributed the least, but want the most from the data. The trust we have with our contributors is our most valuable asset and we will not relinquish it at any price. For most, the data-sharing and data license agreements will help resolve these issues.

**Database Update**

With the closing of the WBT Wildlife Data Centre, the Quarterly Reports that regularly appeared in Wingspan became obsolete. However, we are committed to providing this information, and so a Report of the Wildlife Data Centre will appear in each issue of Wildlife Afield. The report will provide summaries at six month intervals, with the exception of this one, where a full year is described (June 2003 to June 2004).

Despite our ongoing transition and two very busy field seasons, I am excited to report that 284,078 new occurrence records were added to our wildlife databases. Once again numerous contributors came through, sending records from Haines Triangle, Germansen Landing, Tumbler Ridge, Chetwynd, Prince George, Revelstoke, Creston, Nelson, Osoyoos, Kamloops, Kelowna, Queen Charlotte City, Tofino, and hundreds of other locations. The breakdown of records was 272,505 birds, 9,200 reptiles and amphibians, and 2,373 mammals (Figure 1). We also processed a further 3,442 nest cards, bringing our total to 16,511 electronic entries.

Among our many contributors for the 12 month period, Doug Brown (11,105), Mark Hobson (10,513), Jim Wisnia (18.742), Mark Nyhof (7,830), Adrian Dorst (2,443), and Ivar Nygaard-Petersen (3,021) submitted over 1,000 records each. We continued processing historical observations from personal field diaries, museum reports, consultant reports, and periodicals. One such journal, the Muskrat Express, published by the William’s Lake Field Naturalist’s Society, has been a wealth of information over the years.

**About People**

We had one volunteer help us with nest cards. Rod Chilton, a climatologist in Central Saanich, is interested in climate change and the possible effects it may have had on the breeding biology of American Robin (Turdus migratorius). What Rod didn’t anticipate was the large collection of cards for this species, and before being called to work on the Queen Charlotte Islands, he gradually entered records for the species.

A previous volunteer from the University of Victoria, Amber Robinson has since graduated and moved to Manitoba to pursue a Master’s of Science with Dr. Spencer Sealy. Her research topic involves the breeding biology and interactions of Song Sparrow and Brown-headed Cowbird on Vancouver Island and the Queen Charlotte Islands. The research was inspired when they both saw a prototype “movie” of the change in distribution of the Brown-headed Cowbird in British Columbia over the last 117 years. Good luck with your studies Amber. 
  
**Digital Domain**

As if field notes, publications, telephone calls, and oneon-one conversations were not enough to keep us swamped with data, the internet has provided yet another avenue for information to be transferred. In British Columbia there are five major “e-groups”, where individuals post their sightings and stories for other members of that group to read. Of course, for those who do not have internet access, or the time to check the thousands of messages that are generated annually, there is an information transfer gap.

Since early 2002 we have been actively archiving each e-mail that contains wildlife observations, nest records, and interesting notes. In this section of the Wildlife Data Centre report I will try to bridge that gap by highlighting one or two stories in each issue.

On 4 March 2004, Peter Blokker wrote to the interior birding e-group, bcintbirding@yahoogroups.com. This story was passed to him a few days earlier by Ken Waldon from Okanagan Lake.

“A few days ago, a Short-eared Owl [Asio flammeus] was observed on the ground with its wings spread out. On closer inspection it was seen that underneath the owl a Merlin [Falco columbarius] was pinned down. Later the owl was gone, with no sign of blood or feathers on the ground and it is unclear if the owl killed the Merlin and took off with it, or if the Merlin escaped. It seems incongruous that the owl caught the Merlin, unless the Merlin was injured, sick etc.”

Peter concluded by asking, “Has anybody ever seen a Short-eared Owl catch a sizable bird, especially a falcon?” Well Peter, it would seem as though this was a unique observation. While our databases show no records of a Short-eared Owl successfully killing a sizeable bird of prey, there are, however, numerous records of them mobbing and hitting Northern Harriers (Circus cyaneus), a common thief of Short-eared Owl prey. We also have several records of Peregrine Falcon (Falco peregrinus), Gyrfalcon (Falco rusticolus), and Merlin mobbing or stooping on Short-eared Owls. 
From thousands of pellets collected and analyzed in the Lower Mainland, 89% of the diet of the Short-eared Owl consisted of the Townsend’s vole (Microtus townsendii) (Figure 2). In the southern interior 97% of the diet consisted of the meadow vole (M. pennsylvanicus). There always appears to be a positive correlation between vole abundance and owl abundance in the province. Twenty-three species of birds have been identified so far in the diet of the Short-eared Owl in British Columbia with wintering Dunlin (Calidris alpina) being the most common. Prey size ranged from Savannah Sparrow (Passerculus sandwichensis) and Forktailed Storm-Petrel (Oceanodroma furcata) to the largest prey a Bonaparte’s Gull (Larus philadelphia). In other parts of the world, birds may form the major part of the Shorteared Owl’s diet. This is especially true in coastal areas where nesting seabirds provide the only source of food.

**Geographic Locations of Records**

The backlog of historical and current information to be digitized, at times, is overwhelming. While most of the records are from southeastern Vancouver Island, the Lower Mainland, the Okanagan Valley, and the Cariboo-Chilcotin region, we are making an effort to balance data input from locations around the province. Table 1 gives some sense of a typical cross section of source information. Over 700 locations were represented in three databases for the past six months. The 24 locations summarized in Table 1 account for only 23% of the three combined databases of 142,284 records. The unusually high number of records from Revelstoke were extracted from the field notebooks of the late Elmer Callin. Areas of the province that are under-represented in our databases include the central and north mainland coast, the entire north-central portion of the province, the southern and northern Rocky Mountain Trench, and the far northeastern region. Habitats least known include pelagic, alpine (Figure 3), and gas, oil and hydro-electric transmission corridors.

**BC Photo File for Wildlife Records**

In 1971 Wayne Campbell and David Stirling published A Photoduplicate File for British Columbia Vertebrate Records in the scientific journal Syesis (Volume 4:217222). The purpose of the article was to discourage museum collecting by documenting, with photograph or written description, “the occurrence of rare or previously unrecorded vertebrates” in British Columbia. Over the years the file has grown to include other categories such as documentation of raptor nests, field descriptions of animals, nesting colonies, mortality, and aberrant plumages. Each item is catalogued with a unique number, filed as a separate collection, and entered into our databases. We are presently working through a backlog of about 2,400 items that require cataloguing. 

Recently, many black-and-white and colour prints, slides, drawings, field descriptions, and maps of sensitive nest sites have recently been added to the BC Photo File to formally document the records. Some of these include: Acorn Woodpecker (four prints obtained by regional coordinator Doug Brown - Cat. No. 1887) (Figure 4), Wild Turkey (breeding at Metchosin, Darlene Mooney - Cat. No. 1888), Clark’s Nutcracker (Galiano Island - Cat. No. 1889), Spotted Owl (Vancouver, Ron Gruber - Cat. No. 1890), Herring Gull (breeding at Williams Lake , Steve Howard - Cat. No. 1891), leopard frog (Wardner, Dennis A. Demarchi - Cat. No. 1892), Townsend’s Solitaire (winter habitat at Kamloops, Dave Low - Cat. No. 1893), American Dipper (wintering south of Riske Creek, Linda Durrell — Cat. No. 1894), rubber boa (Creston, Linda Van Damme — Cat. No. 1895), Green-tailed Towhee (Reifel Island, Ray Hamaguchi — Cat. No. 1896), gray squirrel (Rossland, F. Don Young — Cat. No. 1897), Clay-colored Sparrow (Bella Coola, Ron Mayo — Cat. No. 1898), and Blue Jay (Wynndel, Norm and Rose Simmons — Cat. No.1899).

**Education and Extension**

Harestad, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby), yellow-bellied marmot (Stan Preston, Cache Creek), images for a book Birds of the Raincoast — Habits and Habitat (Harbour Publishing, Madeira Park), Western Grebe and Northwestern Crow (Bill Beese, Weyerhaeuser), bird species totals for British Columbia (Don Stephenson, Toronto, ON), Bald Eagle prey remains (Ron McLaughlin, Nanaimo), waterfowl images (Linda Van Damme, Creston), biographical information for the late J. E. Victor Goodwill (Alan MacLeod, Victoria Natural History Society), painted turtle (John McKinnon, Prince George), Golden Eagle (Ellie Archer, Calgary, AB), list of birds for mining site near Tumbler Ridge (Lorraine Andrusiak, Keystone Wildlife Research, White Rock), Great Horned Owl (Jean Harding, Saanich), binoculars (Rob Phare, Oliver), Chestnut-backed Chickadee nesting period (Jan Ferguson, Victoria), Bullfrog (Jean Cunningham, Surrey) (Figure 5), Bald Eagle nesting (Rene Roddick, BC Hydro), Okanagan contacts for proposed National Park (Joanna Preston, student, University of Victoria), Broadwinged Hawk, Lewis’s Woodpecker, and Black-throated Green Warbler (Dr. Fred L. Bunnell, Department of Forest Sciences, UBC), Wild Turkey nesting (Darlene Mooney, Metchosin), lecture request (Ian Robertson, British Columbia Field Ornithologists), Great Blue Heron (Lennart Sopuck, Biolinx Environmental Research Ltd., Sidney), and Cooper’s Hawk (Ron McLaughlin, Nanaimo).

Wildlife workshops, specifically related to data recording and databases, were presented in Coquitlam and Burnaby. Wildlife Data Centre lectures were given to the Vancouver Natural History Society, Greater Vancouver Regional District, British Columbia Institute of Technology, Weyerhaeuser (Bill Beese), and Dr. Alton S. Harestad (Simon Fraser University). Wayne Campbell was banquet speaker at the “Fabulous Fundraising Dinner & Auction” on 27 March 2004 to raise money for the operation of the Allan Brooks Nature Centre in Vernon. Wildlife lectures were also given to invited members of the Allan Brooks Nature Centre, North Okanagan Naturalists, and Central Okanagan Naturalists.

**Wildlife Alert - Request for Assistance - Barn Swallow -**

Barn Swallow (Hirundo rustica) breeding populations (Figure 6), especially at some traditional nesting colonies (Table 2) have disappeared or have been reduced to alarmingly low numbers. Jeff Price et al., in their book The Summer Atlas of North American Birds, indicate that the Barn Swallow has undergone a significant decline of 24.1% during the period 1984-1993. This is based on Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) data collected on 2,470 routes in North America. While the quality of the data collected on BBS’s is still being challenged and interpreted, the results clearly serve as an early warning system that a species might be in trouble.

In British Columbia, numbers of sightings and nestings reported each year are also showing dramatic decreases both on the coast and in the interior. The trend is alarming! Over the next year or so we will gather available information, historic and current, and start entering details into our occurrence and nesting databases. The task may take two years before we can actually analyze the information to suggest causes for the decline. However, we have a wonderful start as our occurrence database presently includes over 30,000 records dating back 117 years. 

**WE NEED YOUR HELP **

* Make a concerted effort to locate and record the contents of all Barn Swallow nests. Be aware that many nesting birds have now moved from farmlands to large metal road culverts.

* Visit and survey historical nesting sites and colonies. Some of these are listed in the third volume of The Birds of British Columbia (p. 183). The present status should be recorded even if the site/colony is no longer active.

* Extract historical breeding records from field notebooks and diaries and transfer them with full information to nest cards.

* Extract historical records from field notebooks and diaries and transfer them to the Biodiversity Centre for Wildlife Studies data sheets. An Excel template can be sent to those people who may want to enter their observations directly in a digitized form. Personal databases can also be submitted. Finally, photocopies of field notes can be sent directly to the Centre for entry. While analysis of nest cards is important in determining a probable cause of the decline, single observations collected over a long period from throughout British Columbia are also important.

* Send information to: Biodiversity Centre for Wildlife Studies, PO Box 6218, Station C, Victoria, BC, V8P 5L5

**Contributions, Gifts, and Donations**

An important function of the Wildlife Data Centre is to preserve and catalogue a wide variety of wildlife information and data collections from British Columbia in a centralized provincial repository. The informed and effective “Voice for Wildlife” depends on comprehensive collections of digitized records, library holdings, artwork, and photographic images.

We want to express our gratitude to the following individuals and organizations that have entrusted the Wildlife Data Centre to secure and utilize their generosity for the benefit of all wildlife and their habitats in the province.

INSERT TABLE 2 HERE

Fred L. Bunnell (Surrey): A retired UBC professor, Fred (Figure 7) donated a large portion of his huge personal research library that arrived at the Wildlife Data Centre in Victoria in 73 boxes. This valuable collection of wildlife/ forestry reference material contained long runs of scientific journals (¢.g., Ecology, Journal of Wildlife Management, Journal of Mammalogy, Wildlife Review), hundreds of theses, thousands of reprints, field data from field research (e.g., Bald Eagle in the Lower Mainland, Coast Tailed Frog), books, unpublished reports, and pamphlets. 
Marian Innes (Courtenay): Three boxes of material that included original field notebooks of the late Doug Innes dating back to 1974. The regions best represented were Prince Rupert to Smithers and Vancouver Island. The collection also included reference books, journals, magazines (complete run of Wildlife Review), reports, photographic slides (Figure 8), bird song tapes and records, and theses. Three “hard to get” books included A Distributional List of the Birds of British Columbia by Allan Brooks and Harry S. Swarth [1925], Report on a Collection of Birds and Mammals from the Atlin Region, Northern British Columbia by Harry S. Swarth [1926], and .A Review of the Bird Fauna of British Columbia by J. A. Munro and I. McTaggart Cowan [1947]. 

Glenn R. Ryder (Aldergrove): Another installment of original field notes were transferred by Glenn from his small field notebooks to larger format pages. Again these were purchased by Wayne Campbell and added to Glenn’s impressive collection. Coverage included Alexis Creek, Stum Lake, and Wells Gray Park for 1971. 
Rosamond Sarles (White Rock): Four boxes of assorted natural history literature from the library of the late John G. Sarles along with a monopod, telescope, original bird drawings and paintings, bird song tapes, and coloured slides documenting early field trips. The collection included reference material on plants, regional geology, birds, nature in general, and field guides. Mint editions of Birds of Canada by P. A. Taverner [1949] and Birds of the Early Explorers in the Northern Pacific by Theed Pearse [1968] were new additions to the library.

David Stirling (Victoria): A computer with monitor, keyboard, and printer that will be used for data entry by volunteers.

Allan Brooks Nature Centre (Vernon): A beautiful limited edition, framed print, entitled “October Cottonwoods” by Allan Brooks, one of British Columbia’s pioneer wildlife artists. The print was signed by the artist’s son to authenticate the piece. 
Canadian Forest Products (Chetwynd): Three boxes of original and photocopied reports from the work of consultants and biologists covering the Peace River region.
