**Support for a Shared Vision**

In 1998 a small group of visionary people supported the initiation of a new and centralized database for British Columbia wildlife. The intent was to spend five years entering information electronically, another year to organize the databases, and a final year to establish a common website for information sharing. We are right on track! Over 85% of the information amassed was available in the public domain with the rest coming from supportive naturalists with long histories of record-keeping and extensive field notes. 

From MacMillan Bloedel / Weyerhaueser, we thank Stan Coleman and Ronald T. McLaughlin, from BC Hydro, Tom F. Bailey and Robert M. Bradley, and from Lone Pine Publishing, Shane Kennedy. With support and investment from these individuals, our shared vision has become a reality in British Columbia. 

**Your Data at Work**

*Wildlife Afield* is about making summary information available. That information is a culmination of your field observations and the subsequent donation of those observations to the Wildlife Data Centre. Throughout British Columbia, only a small fraction of the wildlife present at any given time are observed and recorded. An even smaller fraction of that data are available for making decisions on land-use planning, conservation initiatives, and species or habitat management. 

However, from the data you do gather, informed decisions can be made. For example, in the next issue of Wildlife Afield we will show how over 13,000 records of Yellow Warbler throughout British Columbia helped change the way vegetation was being managed at Duck Lake in the Creston Valley. 

Your data can make a difference. Not just in the kinds of articles that appear in Wildlife Afield, but in the quality of information that is requested through the Wildlife Data Centre. As noted in this issue under the *Report on the Wildlife Data Centre*, we are working toward operational Data License Agreements and a sustainable business plan. While fees for data requests will likely be inevitable, we hope that those individuals requesting information are willing to share their own findings.

**Biodiversity Centre for Wildlife Studies: Our Logo**

Upon learning of the formation of a new home for the Wildlife Data Centre and the establishment of a new society, I was invited to design the logo for the Biodiversity Centre for Wildlife Studies. My first idea was to somehow associate a bird with the province of British Columbia, since much of the resources at the Wildlife Data Centre are bird-related. I settled on the idea of a flying bird with an outline of British Columbia behind. For the bird I chose a common British Columbia raptor, the Red-tailed Hawk (*Buteo jamaicensis*). With this species the logo could be interpreted as a hawk, viewed from space, flying over the province in search of food. I thought that the idea of a hawk circling over the province could be compared to the countless numbers of naturalists who scout the province each year in search of birds and other wildlife. It is the information collected by these people that has made the databases so impressive.
