**179 years ago:** Henry Schoolcraft, who collected the first specimen of the Evening Grosbeak, believed that the bird sang only in the evenings. In 1825 he passed this information onto William Cooper, at the Lyceum of Natural History of New York, who named the species *Fringilla vespertina* (now *Coccothraustes vespertinus*) or “finch of the evening.” Although we know that the Evening Grosbeak does not only sing in the evenings the misnomer persists today. 

**61 years ago:** In June 1943, the British Columbia Provincial Museum published its second handbook *The Amphibians of British Columbia* by G. Clifford Carl (Figure 5). The cost was 50 cents initially but was later raised to 60 cents [perhaps to boost profits!]. The amphibian fauna was 20 species. Today, excluding new taxonomic changes by DNA analysis to Spotted Frog and Tailed Frog, one species has been added to the British Columbia list, namely Coeur d’Alene Salamander (*Plethodon idahoensis*). 

The amphibian handbook generated a great deal of interest and hastened the production of a well-balanced reference series on plants and animals in the province over the next 60 years. The first handbook, *Fifty Edible Plants of British Columbia*, was authored by provincial botantist George A. Hardy. 

**57 years ago:** James A. Munro and Ian McTaggart- Cowan in their treatise A Review of the Bird Fauna of British Columbia wrote: *“We feel that the avid search for new records within a political boundary manifest in much current ornithological literature is to be deprecated. Single extra-limital occurrences of birds do not, as a rule, have any faunal significance. A certain number of these undoubtedly are manifestations of an aberrant instinct, others may be storm-driven waifs: but of the least interest are the increasing number whose natural origin in the area can be open to doubt. The long-continued hobby of aviculture has certainly been responsible for the transportation and liberation of certain species of birds which, inhabiting areas sufficiently close by, make their natural appearance in British Columbia not beyond the bounds of possibility. For example, it is known that in 1925 and earlier a number of birds captured in Manitoba were liberated at Burnaby, British Columbia. Amongst these were Pine Grosbeaks, goldfinches, and at least one Baltimore Oriole. A specimen of the last-named species was captured two years later at Chilliwack which is approximately 50 miles from Burnaby.”* 

**54 years ago:** Provincial wildlife biologist Patrick W. Martin summarized the status of the Osprey (*Pandion haliaetus*) (Figure 6) in his *Report on a Wildlife Survey of Wells Gray Park – 1950* as follows: *“These beautiful and interesting raptors are abundant near all large lakes and rivers within the park. They nest on Murtle River near Majerus Ranch and at the Stillwater. They were frequently observed at Clearwater and Azure Lakes during our stay there. We counted at least eight occupied nests on Murtle Lake and several unoccupied ones. Such abundance of Osprey is quite unusual and I think a definite asset to the park. Indiscriminate shooting has seriously reduced the numbers of these birds throughout much of their range and any efforts made to conserve those remaining will be energy well spent.”* 

**32 years ago:** In November 1972, Dr. Ian McTaggart- Cowan and his wife Joyce invited Wayne and Eileen Campbell to dinner at their UBC home to discuss an exciting new project. Wayne was invited to participate in updating the 1947 publication *A Review of the Bird Fauna of British Columbia* by J. A. Munro and I. McT.-Cowan. Wayne and Eileen had already amassed over 300,000 records since 1961 that would provide the base for *The Birds of British Columbia* that officially started on 1 December 1972.
