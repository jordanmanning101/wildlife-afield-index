*Jerry Etzkorn and Janet Etzkorn*

 The Gray Wagtail (Motacilla cinerea) is an Old World species that breeds from the British Isles, southern Scandinavia, central Russia and central Siberia south to northwestern Africa, the Mediterranean region, Asia Minor, Iran, the Himalayas, northern Mongolia, Manchuria, northern Korea, and Japan. It generally winters south of its summer range to central Africa, Sri Lanka, and western New Guinea. In North America it is mainly a casual spring migrant through the Commander and western Aleutians and Pribilof and St. Lawrence islands in Alaska. Elsewhere it is considered accidental (American Ornithologist’s Union 1998).  

 On 26 October 2004, at 1600 hrs., we spotted a yellow- bellied bird on a small gravel beach on the southeast side  of Carmanah Point Lightstation on southwestern Vancouver Island (480 36’ 52” N, 1240  45’ 37” W). The bird was frequently wagging its tail as it vigorously fed on a huge hatch of kelp flies and smaller midges along the tide line. We watched the bird for about 10 min before it flew, with a strong direct flight, into a nearby Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) tree. We returned to the lightstation to complete a weather report. In the meantime, we identified the yellow-coloured wagtail, using the National Geographic Field Guide to the  Birds of North America, as a Gray Wagtail.

 Forty-five min later we returned to the beach to find the bird feeding in the same area. The wagtail walked and snapped insects off the rocks continuing to wag its tail between feeding events. At one point it preened for several minutes. A series of photographs documenting the occurrence were obtained using a digital Nikon Coolpix 4200 camera pressed against a spotting telescope as the bird continued to feed. These images have been catalogued as B C Photo 3059 (Figure 1) and deposited in the scientific photo files at the Biodiversity Centre for Wildlife Studies in Victoria (see Campbell and Stirling 1971).

 The Gray Wagtail is an exceedingly rare bird to find in western North America south of western Alaska. Small (1994) lists a single record for California of an immature bird that was present at the mouth of the Salinas River on 9 and 10 October 1988. There are no satisfactory occurrences from the Yukon Territory prior to 2003 (Sinclair et al. 2003), British Columbia prior to 26 October 2004 (Campbell et al. 1997; R. W. Campbell pers. comm.), and Oregon prior to January 1997 (Russell 1997).
