*Michael I. Preston*  

### Manager’s Message  

Where would we be without our supporters? That’s a question I don’t want to ponder, and judging by your immediate response to support the Biodiversity Centre for Wildlife Studies, it appears I can leave this question unanswered for some time. In just two months following the mailout of Wildlife Afield Vol.1:1, myself and the other Directors were pleased to see so many people join. The success of the Society, and of the Wildlife Data Centre, is dependent on each and every one of your memberships. To all of you, welcome, and thank you for supporting us.

In addition to inspiring the taking of a membership, Wildlife Afield did something else – it encouraged people to help make a difference for wildlife in British Columbia. That difference can be measured in numerous ways, as you will see throughout this issue, but ultimately that measure begins with the donation of your wildlife observations to our centralized permanent repository for wildlife information in British Columbia. As you will see from reading this report of the Wildlife Data Centre, numerous individuals submitted photographs to the BC Photofile, completed and mailed nest cards for inclusion in the BC Nest Record Scheme, and offered their wildlife field notes for inclusion in our wildlife databases. Many other people were motivated to contribute specific data sets and reports to help make articles in this issue more complete, while others were inspired to write notes and articles for future issues of Wildlife Afield. To me, the contents of this report reflect purpose, willingness, reassurance, and passion. To me, your show of support is making the Wildlife Data Centre a success.

### Wildlife Afield - Congratulations

Response to the first issue of Wildlife Afield has been gratifying, and to show our readers that something special has happened, I want to share with you some of the comments we have received.

“Great job and perfect timing!” (Rita Wege, Nelson), “WOW! I had no idea that this was such a professional publication!” (Sherry Lidstone, McLlure), “WOW! - looks great.” (Jude Grass, Surrey), “Congratulations with the release of WildlifeAfield.Ifound it exceptionallywellwritten, carefully put together and presented in a neat and orderly format. The articles were very interesting and extremely  informative.” (Richard Mooney, Kelowna), “I felt like a kid under the Christmas tree when I opened the journal.” (Ivar Nygaard-Petersen, Powell River), “Fabulous job done on Wildlife Afield!” (Amber Robinson, Winnipeg), “I was impressed by the Wildlife Afield first edition ... produced in the middle of a major move and upheaval - well done!” (Mark Hobson, Tofino), “I really enjoyed Wildlife Afield - it is a great publication and I look forward to the next issue” (Vi Lambie, Mackenzie), “Wildlife Afield is a fine journal and fills a niche in the scientific-natural history realm.” (David Stirling, Victoria), “What a good idea! I did enjoy reading Wildlife Afield.” (Trish Reid, Princeton).

### Database Update

The latter half of 2004 was busy for the Wildlife Data Centre, and with the launch of Wildlife Afield, we had to keep the operation flowing smoothly. In addition to regular data entry (e.g., personal field notes, diaries, and reports), we also had to seek specific datasets to complement Feature Articles and Notes appearing in this issue. We were overwhelmed with your support and the data, photos, and reports came flowing in.

For the wood frog profile, dozens of people contributed their personal observations. Specifically, however, we wish to thank Laird Law, Sandra Kinsey, Doug Wilson, Mark Phinney, and Larry Halverson for personally submitting over 1,500 reptile and amphibian observations as a direct result of the wood frog account being prepared. Linda Van Damme entered reptile and amphibian data for the West Kootenay region and submitted 145 records, while Ann Chan-McLeod of the Centre for Applied Conservation Research (UBC) submitted 264 red-legged frog records from northern Vancouver Island. The total number of reptile and amphibian records submitted for the period 1 July to 31 December 2004 was 6,105 (Figure 1), bringing the 2004 total to 14,876. Our database for this group of animals now totals over 60,000 occurrence records.

Given the difficulty of observing most mammal species in British Columbia, either because they are mainly nocturnal, ocean-dwelling, or quite small, it was encouraging to see a good number of observations for this group. From throughout British Columbia, hundreds of records were received for such species as elk, moose, bighorn sheep, white-tailed deer, black bear, beaver, coyote, and harbour seal. We also received good numbers of records for muskrat, long-tailed weasel, gray wolf, orca, harbour porpoise, northern sea lion, river otter, and the increasingly uncommon mountain caribou (Figure 2). In all, 3,860 mammal records were submitted for the period 1 July to 31 December 2004 from such regions as Vancouver Island, the Sunshine Coast, the Queen Charlotte Islands, Powell River and Theodosia Inlet, the West Kootenays, and the Peace River region. This brings the 2004 annual total to 5,644 records and our total database to over 20,000 records.

Bird records were once again the dominant source of new information added to our databases. For the period 1 July to 31 December 2004 we processed 212,294 records for an annual total of 359,178 records. These were from hundreds of locations throughout the province (see Geographic Location of Records below). Doug Brown invested considerable effort for such regions as the Sunshine Coast, the Queen Charlotte Islands, and the Peace River region for a total of 11,826  observations.

Rita Wege submitted 593 records from the Nelson region, as well as the Nelson Winter Duck Count dataset and the Osprey nesting dataset for 1997 to 2004. Rita also went back through the Osprey survey data to extract observations of Canada Goose nesting on Osprey nests. These will be summarized in the upcoming 2004 BC Nest Record Scheme Report. Thank you Rita for the extra effort.

Chris Charlesworth donated 2,969 records, mainly from Kelowna and other nearby locations in the Okanagan Valley. Ivar Nygaard-Petersen continued to submit his monthly bird observations from Powell River and Theodosia Inlet. With his contribution of 2,726 records over the past six months, his total contribution is now over 10,000 records. From the summer of 2004, Mark Nyhof donated 9,455 bird records from various locations across Vancouver Island.

When Linda Van Damme is not sitting at her computer entering records, searching the internet for wildlife reports, reading papers on various natural history topics, giving lectures, and tirelessly promoting the Biodiversity Centre for Wildlife Studies, she’s actually in the field recording wildlife observations from the Creston Valley at all times of the year. One highlight from her notes was during the winters of 2002/2003 and 2003/2004, when it was evident that Northern Pygmy-Owls were fairing quite well in the Creston Valley [and other regions in British Columbia]. While this little owl is a favourite for many naturalists to see, it would be an understatement to say that Linda enjoys seeing them. Just look at Ron Granger’s rendition of such a sighting (Figure 3).

For this reporting period, Linda donated 15,876 records from the West Kootenay and Creston Valley regions. She also coordinated and completed the data entry of observations from Cyril Colonel (1,085), Vic Cousineau (758), Marcia Long (483), and Lorraine Scott (593), who all volunteered their time to compile and submit records

### Geographic Locations of Records

The challenge of adding new information to our databases lies between balancing historical and current records with representing as many locations as possible for better provincial coverage. During the past six months we concentrated our efforts in the Okanagan Valley where some of our most threatened habitats occur.

Some BCWS members were curious about source information and wanted more samples of total numbers of records for more locations listed in the previous issue of WildlifeAfield. Among several datasets compiled for this issue by volunteers in Victoria, three included 156,731 records. Among those three datasets, nearly 800 different locations were represented. The areas that were best represented include the Chilkat Pass area in extreme northwestern BC, the Peace River region, the Queen Charlotte Islands, the Cariboo-Chilcotin region, the lakes and farmlands west of Quesnel, Nicola, the Shuswap Lake area, Okanagan Valley, southern Vancouver Island, and the Lower Mainland.

Numbers presented in Table 1 may be deceiving since they represent highest totals for only the top 15 locations. For example, while only five locations are listed for the Okanagan Valley in Dataset 1, a total of 39 locations with 9,496 records (23 %) were included in the total dataset. The Okanagan Valley was well represented thanks to the field notes of Ken P. Morrison, who completed his M.Sc. thesis on Mourning Doves in the valley in the late 1960s. Some other significant contributions, both historic and current, included the observations of E. M. Anderson, Errol Anderson, W. Anderson, Vicky Atkins, R.N. Atkinson, Alice Beals, Allan C. Brooks, Doug Brown, G. Clifford Carl, Chris Charlesworth, S.J. Darcus, D. Lorne Frost, Violet and Les Gibbard, J.E. Victor Goodwill, Charles deB. Green, Charles J. Guiguet, Bob Houston, Ken Kennedy, Douglas  A. Leighton, Enid Lemon, Robert E. Luscher, Walter. S. Maguire, Arthur L. Meugens, Allister Muir, James A. Munro, I. Laurie Rockwell, Glenn R. Ryder, Ron Satterfield, Chris Siddle, John Stainer, David Stirling, Jim Switzer, E. M. Tait, and David Woolgar.

The large number of records for the Shuswap Lake area, especially Sorrento, were compiled from the 1970 field notes of the late Derek Beacham. All of the Stum Lake records were extracted from the detailed field notes of Glenn R. Ryder who worked as a seasonal park naturalist protecting the American White Pelican colony in the 1970s. Observations from Kaslo were mainly the field notes of Marlene Johnston. The Quesnel sightings were mostly transferred from the 2002 field notes of Penny Haering who lives at Alec Meadow to the west of the city. Significant numbers for the Queen Charlotte Islands were obtained from field notes of Michael Bentley, Doug Brown, Allan Brooks, Neil and Betty Carey, Michelle Shaw, Carol Hoar, Sheila Douglas, Joan Robertson, Michael Spencer, Ken Kennedy, Murray Clark, R. Cummings, Warren Daniels, W. Feyer, C.A. Patch, J. Bristol Foster, Walter S. Maguire, R. Wayne Nelson, Janet Gifford, Mary Morris, Michael S. Rodway, Moira Lemon, Norman Clarkson, Spencer G. Sealy, Tom E. Reimchen, Jerry Etzkorn, R.M. Stewart, Gary S. Davidson, and Al and Irene Whitney, as well as specimen collections stored in state, national, provincial, and municipal museums.

### Digital Domain  

Internet and e-groups continue to be the fastest means of translating information to a wide audience, and will likely remain that way for some time. Thanks to those of you that have agreed to let us continue extracting wildlife observations from those postings. The system works well, not only for individuals uploading their records, but for us also, since we can minimize the amount of time required to track down the details of rare or unusual observations. For 2004, we extracted approximately 10,500 sightings, which comprise about 3 % of our total annual records.

As a result of Wildlife Afield 1:1, Anna Roberts and Phil Ranson of Williams Lake were enticed to submit their electronic postings weekly to the Wildlife Data Centre. At the end of December, Phil prepared and posted a CD that contained all the back-logged wildlife postings for the Cariboo region from 1997 to 2004. Adrian Leather of Quesnel  has also recently started to submit electronic summaries of observations from naturalists in that area.

Digital photography and postings on personal websites is another way for people to share their information. Larry Halverson of Radium submitted numerous digital images of plants and mammals for our files. Of particular interest was a picture of the “Blue-listed” Pygmy Waterlily (Nymphaea tetragona) (Figure 4) taken near Brisco - nearly 700 km south of its known range in British Columbia. In addition to specific images mentioned in the BC Photo File for Wildlife Records, Trevor Forder has allowed us to access images from his website and store the records in our databases (Figure 5).

From the Cariboo region, Phil Ranson submitted several photographs that often accompanied wildlife records gathered by naturalists in the area. Vi Lambie of Mackenzie regularly e-mailed images of rare or unusual species from the Mackenzie banding station. Chris Charlesworth and Richard Mooney of Kelowna both contributed digital images to accompany the Dusky Flycatcher note in this issue - photos that were not used are catalogued in the BC Photo File.

### BC Photo File for Wildlife Records

This growing file, now 33 years old, contains catalogued information on the unusual occurrence, rare habitats, specific nesting locations, abnormal appendages, bizarre plumages and pelages, wildlife accidents, and environmental disasters as proof of documentation for future reference.The collection becomes especially important when additions to animal checklists are being considered and areas are being re-surveyed or checked after a long absence.

The images do not have to be award-winning photographs but they should show some convincing aspects of the topic. Additional written notes can help complement some images. Over the past six months 56 new images were catalogued and archived in the collection. Some of these included: Wandering Salamander (first mainland occurrence, near Sechelt - Glenn R. Ryder), Red-tailed Hawk (pure albino, Watson Slough - R. Wayne Campbell), Gray Wagtail (first BC record, Carmanah Point - Jerry Etzkorn), Canada Warbler (first record for Mackenzie - John Lambie; Figure 6) Common Garter Snake (late activity date, near Helmcken Falls - R. Wayne Campbell), Lark Sparrow (first Peace River breeding, Lynx Creek - Steve Myers), Cattle Egret (invasion into Creston Valley; Arnold Labrentz; Figure 7), Great Horned Owl (unusual nest site, Creston Valley, summer 2004 - Larry Prosser), Harlequin Duck (breeding site, Kaipit Creek - Wayne Matkoski), Trumpeter Swan (brood, Halfmoon Lake - R. Wayne Campbell), Black-backed Wagtail (rare BC occurrence, Harrison Mills - Lorne Hansen), Northern Hawk Owl (documents invasion, Springhouse - Phil Ranson ), Great Egret (rare BC occurrence, Williams Lake - R. Wayne Campbell; Figure  8), Brant (rare interior occurrence, Revelstoke - Orville Gordon), Barred Owl (documents occurrence, Tatlayoko Valley - Kris Andrews), Ash-throated Flycatcher (noteworthy record, Boundary Bay - Len Jellicoe; Figure 9), Ancient Murrelet (rare inland occurrence, Sunnybrae - Sarah Petznick), American Badger (noteworthy record, West Creston - Marcia Long), Bobcat (rare sighting, Creston - Marcia Long; Figure 10), and McKay’s Bunting (rare sighting, Iona Beach - Thomas C. Shermer; Figure 11).

### Education and Extension

Over 130 requests for information were received and processed using our library, databases, and image banks. Sample requests included information on Great Blue Heron (Isabelle Houde, Centre for Applied Conservation Research, UBC), Hoary Marmot (Brian King, Princeton), Oregon spotted frog (James Perry, Chilliwack), indicator species for south coastal BC (Carol Murray, Victoria), Anna’s Hummingbird (Ryan Graves, Surrey), Great Blue Heron, Northern Goshawk, and Cooper’s Hawk (Bob Harris, Terminal Forest Products Ltd., Richmond), Bewick’s Wren (Ron McLaughlin, Nanaimo), Mountain Beaver (John Carey, Surrey), feeding birds (Terry Finch, C-FAX radio, Victoria), Black-capped Chickadee (John Thompson, Burnaby), Great Blue Heron (Nina Raginsky, Salt Spring Island), Northern Goshawk, Cooper’s Hawk, and Common Raven (Sally Leigh-Spencer, Duncan), Great Horned Owl (Bill Johnson, Sidney), Black-backed Wagtail (Lorne Hansen, Harrison Mills), BCNRS Report (Jan Bradshaw, Chase), Trumpeter Swan (Marian White, Calgary, AB), wildlife festivals (Lex Hedley, Vancouver), Great Gray Owl (Eric Cooper, San Diego, CA), frogs (Marianne Munro, Fort St. John), Great Blue Heron (Terry Spence, Victoria), Lark Sparrow (Steve Myers, Hudson’s Hope), hummingbird feeding (Joan Williston, Arcata, CA), Brown-headed Cowbird (Larry Halverson, Parks Canada, Radium Hot Springs), Williamson’s Sapsucker (Les Gyug, Westbank), bird of prey images (Linda Van Damme, Creston), Oregon spotted frog (Linda Robertson, New Westminster), Prairie Falcon (Tony Greenfield, Sechelt), Great Blue Heron (Cindy Young, Chilliwack), western toad (John Murray, Prince George), Great Egret (Jim Peters, Williams Lake), Double-crested Cormorant (Cyril Colonel, Creston), hummingbirds (Lisa Howard, Surrey), Rufous Hummingbird (David Schutz, Coquitlam), migrating hawks (Stephen Stobart, Victoria), Marbled Murrelet (Josh Malt, Simon Fraser University), Great Blue Heron and American White Pelican (Powell River Peak newspaper), House Sparrow (Jim Stewart, Houston), wildlife images (Pierre Vernier, Centre for Applied Conservation Research, UBC), Great Egret (Sandy Proulx, Williams Lake), BC bird checklists (Anthea Farr, Surrey), Great Blue Heron (Stan Rathbone, Prince George), Swainson’s Thrush (Arnold Ainley, Berkley, CA), bullfrog (Mark Hume, The Globe & Mail, Vancouver), Sandhill Crane (John M. Cooper, Errington), and wildlife images (Fred Bunnell, Centre for Applied Conservation Research, UBC). Wildlife workshops on data and nest recording, field survey methods, and electronic databases were presented in Victoria, Port Coquitlam, Duncan, and Burnaby. Wildlife lectures, television and radio appearances, and newspaper  interviews were presented to the Hul’qumi’num Treaty Group (Ladysmith), Central Okanagan Naturalists Club (Kelowna), Simon Fraser University (Burnaby), Weyerhaeuser (Nanaimo), Vancouver Public Library (Vancouver), C-FAX radio (Victoria), The New VI Breakfast Show (Victoria), CRTV (Campbell River), Comox Valley Record, Campbell River Mirror, Powell River Peak newspaper, and Nanaimo News Bulletin. Illustrated public lectures were also presented in Vancouver, Tofino, Nanaimo, and Courtenay.

### A Little Effort Goes a Long Way

One of the most common questions we hear at wildlife workshops and lectures after showing a species distribution or relative abundance map is, “How do we account for observers being concentrated in some areas, but not in others?” This is not an unreasonable question, especially considering that with good science, this element is critical to any good study design. But with random observations, varying skill levels among naturalists, emphasis on “hot spots”, and the immense size of the province, controlling for effort is very difficult, unless you have a very large dataset and some baseline information.

At the Wildlife Data Centre we are fortunate to have both. But even with over 4.3 million records, gaps exist, and some assumptions must be made. In November and December of 2004 I spent a considerable amount of time developing a method for measuring effort. Thus far, reasonable progress  has been made, although much work remains to be done.

A preliminary measure of effort is shown in Figure 12. The values are cumulative totals of the calculated effort for each of the 1,170 National Topographic grids (1:50,000) by year. From 1887 to 1920, effort was low and relatively constant, with only a few grids sampled and few species seen. From 1920 to 1955 effort increased gradually as more grids were sampled, and greater numbers of species were seen per grid. From 1956 to 1978 effort increased exponentially, with hundreds of grids, and many species per grid, being sampled. This spike occurs roughly at the time when birdwatching became a popular recreational hobby. The lull in the 1980s reflects two important issues: 1) a decrease in record gathering while The Birds of British Columbia Vol. I & II was in production; and; 2) an economic recession that resulted in a growing number of people with less time and money for recreation. In the Wildlife Data Centre library, however, we are fortunate to have acquired numerous field books from some observers, which may help bridge this gap. That data is currently awaiting entry.

The spike in effort in the late 1990s and early 2000s is the reflection of a concerted effort to keep up with new information. In late 2000 I implemented a data-tracking system to minimize the chance that new data would be filed for several years before being entered. Finally, the sharp dip in effort for 2004 is quite simply a data entry backlog, which is currently estimated at about 8 - 14 months, depending on the amount of new information coming in, and the time that it arrives.

During the next few months, further developments for understanding effort will be pursued through a joint project between the Biodiversity Centre for Wildlife Studies and the Centre for Applied Conservation Research at the University of British Columbia. Those findings will be reported in future issues of Wildlife Afield, either as Feature Articles or Notes, or as updates in the Report on the Wildlife Data Centre.

### Wildlife Alert - Request for Assistance

**Yellow Warbler**

The Yellow Warbler (Dendroica petechia) (Figure 13) is a familiar species to many of us with its brilliant plumage, distinct song, and affinity for riparian or wetland-associated habitats. Sadly, this species appears to be decreasing in British Columbia, with declines estimated at 2 % and 3 % for interior and coastal regions respectively (The Birds of British Columbia, Vol. IV). Although specific causes of decline are unknown, it is understood that wetland-draining, willow and small deciduous tree-browsing by cattle, increased rates of Brown-headed Cowbird (Molothrus ater) nest parasitism at human-modified habitat edges, and habitat loss and fragmentation are contributing factors.

At the Biodiversity Centre for Wildlife Studies, in conjunction with the Centre for Applied Conservation Research at UBC, we are currently investigating the potential effects of climate change on the distribution and occurrence of the Yellow Warbler. Choosing this species, in addition to notable declines, was based on an earlier analysis that utilized 13,252 occurrence records from 1887 to 2002. From that analysis, preliminary data showed this species to be widely distributed throughout the province, with two notable concentrations at Dawson Creek and Six Mile Slough in the Creston Valley, with threats of habitat alteration at the latter. With our large dataset and ongoing investigation of observer effort, we are confident that further analyses will be revealing.

However, we need your help. In order to do these analyses we are particularly interested in records that document first spring arrival, last autumn departure, date of first egg in  nest, date of first young in nest, date of first fledging, and any evidence of nest parasitism. We are looking for both historical and new information, especially for areas that are seldom visited as popular bird-watching locations. Every observation counts. To submit records, please follow the instructions at the end of this section.  

**Barn Swallow**

In the 49th Annual British Columbia Nest Record Scheme Report, and in Wildlife Afield 1:1, we announced a concern for the apparent decrease in Barn Swallow (Hirundo rustica) (Figure 14) populations and breeding sites in British Columbia. We asked participants of the British Columbia Nest Record Scheme, and contributors to our wildlife databases, to pay special attention in the summer of 2004 to nesting sites and areas of aggregation. In particular, we asked people to visit known historical breeding sites to confirm current breeding status, as well as to highlight new breeding areas and reproductive success. While we are still in the process of compiling the 50th annual report, it is evident that many of you cared to follow through with this endeavour. As evidenced in Table 2, more “current year” breeding observations were recorded in 2004 than for both historical and current year records in any year from 1999 to 2003. Also in 2004, a big effort was made to compile historical breeding records from field diaries and notebooks.

Four people excerted a particularly large effort to locate and follow the progress of Barn Swallow nests in 2004. First and foremost was Linda M. Van Damme and Cyril Colonel, who actively searched dozens of barns, sheds, houses, shacks, shantys, culverts, and any place else a Barn Swallow might place a nest in the Creston Valley. In total, they located 179 nests of which 87 (49 %) were active. Linda and Cyril followed as many nests as possible through succession and tallied 241 nestlings (average of 2.8 per nest), and 178 fledglings (2.0 per nest).

R. Wayne Campbell located and tracked the progress of 39 Barn Swallow nests. Most were from southwestern British Columbia (74 %) while the remainder were from the central interior and Peace River region. From Lemmen’s Inlet near Tofino, Mark Hobson went through his field notebooks and compiled the breeding chronology and reproductive success of a pair of Barn Swallows nesting at his float-house from 1997-2004.

We are confident that Barn Swallow populations in British Columbia are declining, and Bird Studies Canada appears to agree, since they followed our lead and also issued an alert for this species. It is comforting to learn that in at least some parts of British Columbia (e.g., Creston Valley), relatively large breeding populations appear to be  doing well. However, like any wild species, fluctuations occur annually and it is difficult to determine if 2004 was a good or poor year.

We hope that in 2005 more contributors will assist with the effort to understand this troubled species. Of particular interest would be information on successive broods, total young fledged per breeding pair, and breeding chronology extent - especially date of first egg and date of last fledging.

**To help make a difference for these species, please:**

- Make a concerted effort to locate and record the contents of all Barn Swallow and Yellow Warbler nests.

- Visit and survey historical nesting sites for Barn Swallow, and check rarely visited areas for Yellow Warbler.

- Extract historical breeding records from field notebooks and transfer them with full information to nest cards.

- Extract historical occurrence records from field notebooks and diaries and transfer them to the Biodiversity Centre for Wildlife Studies data sheets. An Excel template can be sent to those people who may want to enter their observations directly in a digitized form. Personal databases can also be submitted. Finally, photocopies of field notes can be sent directly to the Centre for entry. While analysis of nest cards is important in determining a probable cause of the decline, single observations collected over a long period from throughout British Columbia are important.

- Please send information to: Biodiversity Centre for Wildlife Studies, P. O. Box 6218, Station C, Victoria, BC. V8P 5L5.

### Contributions, Gifts, and Donations

The Wildlife Data Centre serves as British Columbia’s comprehensive repository for digital databases, literature, and photographic files on all wildlife. We are grateful to the following people and organizations for their support:

Dennis A. Demarchi (Victoria): A collection of papers and symposia on the Marbled Murrelet and the marine environment, provincial government reports, and a rare copy of Field Studies of the Falconiformes of British Columbia, by Frank L. Beebe.

Margaret (Peggy) E. Goodwill (Victoria): Three complete years of detailed field notes on bird and mammal observations in British Columbia recorded by the late J.E. Victor Goodwill were picked up from Peggy in December 2004. These “samples” (about 14 inches in height!) will be used to determine the approach necessary for electronic data entry and the amount of time required to transfer breeding records to nest cards. The entire collection, consisting of at least two four-drawer legal size filing cabinets, will be officially transferred in January 2005. A report summarizing its contents will be published in Wildlife Afield 2:1.

Mark Hobson (Tofino): Notebook No.21 arrived in December and covered the period May through December 2004. Again, a variety of wildlife notes, accompanied by many delightful drawings of life around Tofino and Lemmens Inlet, were well documented.

Glenn R. Ryder (Aldergrove): Two more instalments of original field notes were transferred by Glenn from his small field notebooks to larger format pages. These notes, that have been purchased annually by Wayne Campbell since 1968, have been added to Glenn’s collection that now occupies over 10 linear feet of library space. The areas represented included Aldergrove, Celista, Harrison Lake, Hope, Kamloops, Kelowna, Keremeos, Langley, Lillooet, Matsqui, Nicola Valley, Princeton, Scotch Creek, Spences Bridge, Surrey, Vedder Mountain, and White Lake. These complete his notes for 1947 and 1971 and assorted years between that totalled 714 pages. Glenn still has 27 years of transferring to complete!

Chris Siddle (Vernon): A collection of 37 colour prints and slides documenting the occurrence of unusual and rare birds that accumulated during his term as British Columbia editor for American Birds from 1991 to 1994. As well we received field notes for 2004.

Watkin Mossman (Victoria): A mint copy of Bird Study in British Columbia by J. A. Munro (1931) was donated to the library. Watkin, 104 years old, was given the book by his parents to encourage his love of birds.

Central Okanagan Naturalists Club (Kelowna): A generous donation of $350 was received from the birders group of the CONC that will be used toward the cost of publishing Wildlife Afield.  

### Questions and Answers  

The Wildlife Data Centre receives numerous e-mails, letters, faxes, and telephone calls requesting information to clarify some issue concerning wildlife. Using our databases  and library we try to answer these questions with information- based facts. Some of our answers may be of interest to our  members.  

Q1: Janice Sawyer called to get clarification on whether she should clean nest boxes at the end of the summer (Figure 15). She has Mountain Bluebirds and Tree Swallows using the boxes each year on her property near Kamloops.

A1: This is a contentious issue that has been hotly debated for years. Purists believe that since the birds do not clean their nest boxes before they migrate and do not remove materials in the spring before renesting, the boxes should be left alone. Others believe strongly that a cleaned nest box is more appealing to returning birds - like a fresh start. They also believe parasites like ants, lice, mites, and fleas are totally removed.

The main concern is the possibility that nests may become infected with parasitic blowfly (Protocalliphora spp.) that attacks nestlings. The parasite, of which there are at least 28 known species, ranges from Alaska throughout Canada and most of the contiguous United States into Mexico.

In spring female blowflies lay their eggs in nests containing newly hatched young after spending the winter away from the nest box in some natural crevice. Sometimes eggs are deposited directly on the nestling. Eggs hatch in 24 to 48 hours into grayish, oval-shaped maggots about 2 cm long. These blood-sucking larvae immediately move into the upper parts of the nest and at night attaches to fleshy parts of the nestling’s body to feed. This nocturnal adaptation assures the parasite that adult birds will not feed on them. A nestling with 10 or more attached blowfly larvae jeopardizes its future. Depending on weather, temperature, and the species of Protocalliphora, the larvae mature between 7 and 15 days after which they pupate. After another 9 to 36 days adult blowflies emerge looking for another nest to parasitize. Precise timing is crucial for this parasite to be successful.

Blowfly pupae are naturally vulnerable to attack by jewel wasps (Nasonia spp.). These small, iridescent insects spend the winter inside the discarded pupal cases of the blowfly. In spring they emerge and immediately seek out pupating blowflies. One to many eggs are laid on the outside of the developing blowfly pupae. The eggs hatch quickly and soon the wasp larvae are busy consuming the blowfly pupae and using it to mature. Within 10 days the full-grown wasps are looking for mates again to continue the cycle. Jewel wasps overwinter in blowfly pupal cases where they go into a torpor state to survive low temperatures. Cleaning out nest boxes may kill the encased jewel wasps that result in fewer animals to parasitize blowflies the following spring. It is not known if the wasps can survive the winter in discarded nests.

There is some scientific evidence that removing material from nest boxes, supposedly to reduce parasite loads, may not be in the best interests of the bird. In one study on Eastern  Bluebirds researchers suggested the bluebirds preferred “re- working old nest material to building a completely new nest  and that choice of boxes with old nests actually enhances parasite control.” In a field study of Tree Swallows in the Creston Valley, W.B. Rendell and N.A.M. Verbeek from Simon Fraser University concluded that “the common habit of removing old nests from boxes can affect nest-site and nest-building behaviour.”

Q2: Mike Bajger, manager of the Pine Cone Motor Inn in Chetwynd, has a friend in town who was really concerned about woodpecker damage to trees in his yard. The damage consisted of hundreds of neat rows of holes punched into the trunks and branches of trees (Figure 16). He was concerned that the trees would die and wondered if there was a way to discourage the woodpeckers short of shooting them.

A2: The woodpeckers of concern are sapsuckers. In British Columbia, there are four species: Red-breasted Sapsucker (Figure 17), Williamson’s Sapsucker, Red-naped Sapsucker, and Yellow-bellied Sapscuerk. It is the latter that lives in northeastern British Columbia (Sphyrapicus varius). Unlike most other woodpeckers in British Columbia, this species drills small holes, called “sap wells”, into the bark of trees. It later returns to feed using its long, bristly tongue to collect the oozing sap and insects trapped in it. At least 44  more species of birds in North America are opportunistic sap- feeders but do not drill their own holes (e.g., hummingbirds,  nuthatches, kinglets, waxwings, and warblers). Many squirrels also love the nutritional value of fresh sap.

Sapsuckers are known to bore holes in at least 258 kinds of trees, shrubs, and vines in North America. The favourite trees in British Columbia include western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla), western white pine (Pinus monticola), Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), cascarra (Rhamnus purshiana), western redcedar (Thuja plicata), white spruce (Picea glauca), black spruce (Picea mariana), willow (Salix spp.), red alder (Alnus rubra), white birch (Betula papyrifera), water birch (Betula occidentalis) trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides), and vine maple (Acer circinatum).

Sapsuckers drill neat single rows of holes mostly in the spring when the upward flow of sap from the roots rise in the tree. Almost all drillings occur in living trees. In northern areas of British Columbia birches become a main source of summer food for our three sapsucker species.

Sapsuckers are often considered “nuisance” or “problem” birds by foresters, landowners, orchard-growers, and landscapers as their workings may weaken or kill a tree, afford direct access to the tree by invading insect pests and disease borne pathogens, or cause blemishes on the tree that appear unsightly.  

There have been many suggestions of ways to discourage sapsuckers from feeding on trees. The best solution is to simply tolerate the damage, knowing that sapsuckers have evolved to feed in such a manner, and also provide food for many other animals.

In some cases, sapsuckers eat other forest pests. Researchers have argued that for the lumber industry it would be more expensive to “control” sapsuckers than its direct losses to commercial sales. The Canadian Forest Service advises that lightly attacked trees usually make a complete recovery from sapsucker workings. In some cases individual birds may be discouraged from private yards with noisemakers, streamers using strips of aluminum foil, reflectors, plastic owls, and flashing whirlers. Unfortunately, many sapsuckers quickly become accustomed to such devices, learning that they are harmless. There are also a few, often sticky, chemical bird repellents available commercially (e.g., Tanglefoot, Bird Stop, Roost-No-More) but care is required for use.

It should be noted that over 82 % of all birds occurring in British Columbia, including sapsuckers, are protected by the international Migratory Birds Convention Act. Most of the remaining species are protected under the provincial Wildlife Act. Therefore, shooting is not a control option.
