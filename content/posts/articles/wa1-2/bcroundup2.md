### Field Notes and Caring People

Unusual and surprising wildlife dramas and events happen daily and some of us are fortunate to witness them. In some cases we find injured or abandoned wildlife that need our help. In others we watch in awe at some unusual behaviour. The following story is a just one of the chance happenings that some of our fellow naturalists have encountered and are willing to share with our members.

### Biological Control  

Milo D’Angeles, when he lived at Burnaby Lake in the 1970s, organized his large lakeshore property for wildlife, especially swallows and Wood Ducks. He got rid of his chickens and modified an old two-story barn for swallows. He knocked out all of the windows, got rid of any obstructions, cob webbing, and string, and opened the “hotel” for Barn Swallows. Each year he had between 40 and 60 pairs nesting on the rafters with most raising two broods each nesting season.

Rather than spray insecticides and pesticides Milo would let the swallows eat the insects. In the late summer, prior to migration, the Barn Swallow families would gather in huge flocks in nearby trees and bushes. In mid-August one year the craneflies were particularly abundant. While the Barn Swallows feasted on the insects around the yard many made their way into Milo’s house and soon were flying around every room that was not closed. Many of the Barn Swallows would gather on windowsills looking in at the flying craneflies. He was particularly annoyed at the number of craneflies that made their way into his open but meshed sundeck where he enjoyed eating supper each evening. He soon realized that if he left the door open an hour or so before dinner the Barn Swallows might come in and feed on the flies. It wasn’t long before the swallows knew they had a confined but choice feeding spot and they continued feeding until they departed in late August. The craneflies disappeared and Milo thanked them by keeping his “swallow hotel” standing for another year.  

### News of Friends

Murray Clark: After 24 years as a field biologist working throughout British Columbia with Ducks Unlimited Canada Murray retired in March 2004. He was a regular contributor  to The Birds of British Columbia project and still remains active as a volunteer with many Ducks Unlimited projects.

Chris Siddle: In spring 2004 Chris had an offer he couldn’t refuse – a trip to Tasmania to visit Gary Davidson. He and his wife Sonja spent the month of August touring the area, looking for the Tasmanian devil, adding new birds to his life list, and visiting Queensland.

Joanna Preston: Joanna recently completed her B.Sc. at the University of Victoria in the Department of Biology. While attending she worked on two projects that are currently being developed for publication: “Bilateral Asymmetry in Predator-Prey Interactions in a Population of Threespine Stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) in Drizzle Lake, Queen Charlotte Islands” and “The Function of Ventral Colouration in Avian Piscivores”.

Laurie Rockwell: Despite his own research on the Gray Flycatcher and being involved in numerous other activities, Laurie is assisting a University of British Columbia Ph.D. student.  

### From the Archives

107 years ago: The first occurrence of the Brown-headed Cowbird in British Columbia was documented by Allan Brooks, at Sumas, on May 26, 1897. Fourteen years later, on June 27, 1911, James A. Munro found the first evidence of breeding. The nest containing a cowbird egg was found at Okanagan Landing and the host was a Chipping Sparrow. Today, this parasitic species has been recorded in 371 of the 1,170 grids in British Columbia.

92 years ago: Ring-necked Pheasants (Phasianus colchicus) were first introduced to the Creston Valley and shipped in a wicker crate (Figure 1) to Dr. Henderson in 1912. The pheasants arrived via Dr. Green in Cranbrook who obtained the birds from a hatchery in the Okanagan. Mr. Guy Constable, through his son Bill, donated this crate to the Creston Valley Wildlife Management Area. It was stored there until it was agreed that it be donated to the Creston & District Historical Museum Society for display. Two years later, on 20 October 1914, the following was published in the Creston Review newspaper: “Lest any hunter should be tempted to take a crack at the pheasants, which are quite thick in these parts, have note the penalty for killing them is $100.00”. On 8 October 1964, the Creston Valley Advance published the following: “Despite pleas by the Creston Wildlife Afield  92 Valley Rod and Gun Club the provincial game department has refused to change the open season on hen pheasants to a closed one. Local sportsmen feel there are too few hen pheasants in this area to allow even one kill per hunter.”  

82 years ago: Percy A. Taverner, Curator of Ornithology at the Victoria Memorial Museum [later the National Museum of Canada], on a visit to the Okanagan Valley in 1922 wrote in his report Notes on the Birds of the Okanagan Valley, B.C. – 6 May to 21 June 1928: In 1922, “This species [Sage Thrasher] was discovered in the vicinity of White Lake by C. deB. Green. Specimen taken by him 21 June 1906 and given to Brooks [Alan] now in our collection [Victoria Memorial Museum].”

“Brooks visited the spot 21 Aug 1919 and took a number of specimens, adult and young flying and found a number of nests. He saw numbers more than he took.”

“We [P. A. Taverner et al.] visited the same locality, the sage hills near White Lake on 30 May [1922] but though we found some old nests no birds could be discovered. On 4 June Laing [Hamilton M.] having bivouacked the night there saw one bird in the early morning but it dived into the brush and could not be routed again. 11-13 June he made a big circuit on his motor cycle, White Lake, Keremeos, and the Similkameen Valley down to the Richter Pass and back into the Osoyoos again. He found much luxurient sage country but failed to see or hear anything like a Sage Thrasher. Either the species has deserted the locality or it is a very late arrival – later even than 13 June.”

“Brooks says it is a very elusive bird but in the early  morning takes to the sage brush tops and sings for a short while. The fact that we found old nests speaks for the thoroughness of our search but that some of them were occupied indicates that the species was at least at that time not building.”

64 years ago: A delightful and thought-provoking day entry in the field notes of F. M. Shillaker from the Chezacut area reads: “11 July 1940, Thursday. While looking for new plants in the spring I was very surprised to find I had almost completely passed over a Wilson’s Snipe which was squatting there and moreover the dog was ranging unconcernedly within a few inches of it also and did not flush it. These birds lie very close at times and are almost unflushable. He only moved a few feet when compelled to move. I have found the same thing with willow grouse in very hot weather.”

“The air was alive with singing robins this evening at dusk. I stood on the hillside and listened for a long time. With the number of their nests one finds robbed by squirrels and crows and the number of nests one finds deserted with eggs in one wonders that any are left to rejoice at all yet at the time a philosophy that can cut out black grief and revel in the joy of forgetful healthy living would be a Godsend to the world to-day.”

54 years ago: On 6 September 1950, the British Columbia Fish and Game Branch first introduced Chukar [Partridges] to the Thompson Valley where they released 17 birds on the north bank of the Thompson River near Kamloops. Their purpose was to investigate the possibility of an experimental hunting season. The stocking program continued in the south-central portion of the province until 1955 when a total of 2,606 birds had been released. Release sites included Ashcroft (501 birds), Kamloops (305 birds), Kelowna (67 birds), Keremeos (331 birds), Okanagan Falls (419 birds), Oliver (499 birds), Spences Bridge (72 birds), and Vernon (412 birds). In 1959, the Chukar hunting season was officially open from 12 September to 30 November with a daily bag limit of 10 and a possession limit of 30 birds.

38 years ago: In his Report on Wildlife Survey, Creston Flats – Summer 1966, Robert Greyell wrote: “During the time there are young in the nest, the adult Osprey are very protective and will attack any large bird near their nest. In one instance, when several Great Blue Herons were scared up from the river bank and flew near an Osprey nest, the Ospreys attacked the slower flying herons ferociously and forced them into the trees and down into the brush on the river banks. Two herons were seen hanging helplessly upside-down being dived and clawed at by the Osprey.”  1:2 December 2004 Figure 1.

35 years ago: Habitat improvement projects were continued throughout the Lower Mainland region by provincial government biologists. In their annual report for 1969, habitat alterations were completed for the Serpentine Flats (Fen) Reserve: “Approximately 2500 lbs. of Shearex (75 % Nitroglycerin), which were donated to the B.C. Waterfowl Society by Canadian Industries Ltd., were used to create 6 pothole complexes in the 50 acre southwest field. Average pothole dimensions of 100 ft. by 20 ft. by 4 ft. deep were achieved by placing approximately 10 lbs. of explosives in holes drilled in a zig-zag pattern 4 ft. deep and 8 to 10 ft. apart. Best results were achieved when 100 to 200 lbs. of explosives were detonated simultaneously.”

“Ground-water immediately filled all holes and remained all winter. The area was baited with barley, oats, millet and peanut butter after the hunting season closed, in an effort to stimulate waterfowl use.”

Birds of Chile by Alvaro Jaramillo [2003]. 424 pages. (paperback), 96 colour plates. Princeton University Press. $42.00 US (available on line). Reviewed by Michael Force.  

At last, I’ll finally be able to sort out those confounding cinclodes and frustrating furnariids next time I go to Chile. Chile is blessed (to some, cursed) with an abundance of drab grayish and brown birds. Until very recently, Chile was also cursed by a lack of a comprehensive and up-to-date field guide. Anyone who has birded in Chile has certainly felt the curse of Braulio Araya and Guillermo Millie’s Guia de Campo de las Aves de Chile, the outdated and almost useless Field Guide to the Birds of Chile.

Birds of Chile, by a Chilean ex-pat, fills a huge void for a fascinating country and is one of the best single-country field guides to hit the market in many years. It embodies the perfect ideal to which all field guides aspire: ease of use, compact (1.3 x 14 x 21 cm), informative yet concise, loaded with hundreds of gorgeous illustrations, and good maps. The book employs the popular and user-friendly plate with facing  page text and rangemap format. Four hundred and seventy- three species are illustrated with an average of 5-6 species per  plate, so the plates rarely appear cluttered and intimidating. With a few exceptions (primarily Tyrant Flycatchers) every species is represented by multiple images. For example, a quick examination reveals six illustrations for Kermadec Petrel, 12 for the confusingly variable Common Miner, and a whopping 14 for Variable Hawk. Numerous thumbnails scattered throughout illustrate flight characteristics, useful field marks, plumage variation, habitat, and behaviour. In addition, Latin names are given for all illustrated subspecies, superior to giving the subspecies an arbitrary geographic moniker. The only major flaw with the plates is that several in my copy were printed far too dark and some of these were painted on dark backgrounds confounding the problem.

The text is cutting-edge field identification, presenting everything that is known about Chilean bird identification and distribution as well as a lot that wasn’t, at least not until the publication of this guide. Supplementing the outstanding species accounts are introductory chapters on Habitats and Eco-geography of Chile, migration and vagrancy, seabirds, and basics of field identification. There is also a very useful account on the aging and moult of gulls, terns, and jaegers. The inclusion in the Appendix of carefully researched nomenclatural and taxonomic information cross-referenced with the main text vastly improves the book’s usefulness as a general reference for Chile’s avifauna. Curiously, my copy lacks Latin names in the Appendix, present in other copies I have seen. Another unfortunate flaw is the lack of several lines of information in a few species accounts. These problems are production errors and will likely be corrected in future printings.

There simply has never been anything of this caliber for Chile. It is a sumptuous delight to thumb through, enthralled by the quality of artwork and accurate renderings of cryptic Wildlife Afield  and exotic species. Even if one doesn’t plan to visit Chile anytime soon, this is a worthwhile book to own, if only to be reminded of how good field guides can be.

Kingbird Highway by Kenn Kaufman [2000]. Mariner Books. $19.95 CAN (softcover). Reviewed by Chris Charlesworth.

Kingbird Highway tells of the epic journeys of a teenaged boy who chased his wildest dreams across North America in pursuit of the record number of bird species seen in one year. At 17 years old Kenn hitch-hiked across the continent, covering over 111,000 kilometres in search of common and rare birds. He was one tough kid, subsisting on crackers and sometimes pet food, saving his minimal budget for plane and ferry tickets to places, like the Pribilof Islands, which couldn’t be reached by road. His vivid descriptions of the best birding spots from Alaska to Brownsville, Texas, are a delight to read. Despite encounters with the law, wild drivers, and even his own desire to have a girlfriend, Kaufman is triumphant in his quest for birds, and discovers, at the same time, his own limits and his own identity. Kingbird Highway is not only an important document about the evolution of one of North America’s top ornithologists; it is also an entertaining record of the evolution of New World birding, from the fairly obscure and sedate hobby of retired people to the popular and fast growing full-on avian pursuit called ‘birding’ today. Kaufman captures the 1970s with wit and insight. His fond descriptions of the late Ted Parker and Roger Tory Peterson are enlivening, giving the reader a glimpse of what these birding celebrities were all about. This is a great read.

Handbook of the Birds of the World – Volume 9 Cotingas to Pipits and Wagtails by Josep del Hoyo, Andrew Elliot, and David Christie (eds.) [2004]. Lynx Editions. ~$200 CAN (hardcover). Reviewed by Chris Siddle.  

Handbook of the Birds of the World, the massive multi- volume reference to the world’s birds, the first to illustrate  every species, began publication in 1992 and has since become the standard world reference. The editors, two Spaniards and an Englishman, not only have recruited hundreds of the world’s experts to write accounts, but also have avoided most of the delays that plague many other ornithological works. They have published on schedule 9 of the projected 16 volumes, and this is the latest, containing accounts of the races, plumages, feeding habits, breeding habits, voice, distribution, and conservation status of about  800 passerines, including cotingas, manakins, tyrant- flycatchers, New Zealand wrens, scrub-birds, lyrebirds,  larks, swallows, pipits and wagtails. Among them are 24  species that regularly occur in BC, plus numerous vagrants and occasional visitors. Species accounts are illustrated by large colour plates (78 of them in Vol. 9) illustrating the major plumages of every species, painted by some of the world’s best bird artists. Species accounts range from 1000 (Western Wood-Pewee) to 1500 words (Eastern Kingbird) and end with bibliographies containing 20 to 80 references. In addition, each family is introduced by a detailed overview of systematics, morphology, habitat, general habits, voice, food and feeding habits, breeding movements, relationships with man, and conservation, expressed in clear and simple prose, often with as much text as a small book. These introductions are also accompanied by full bibliographies, plus dozens of high quality color photographs, many printed for the first time. The family introductions are worth the purchase price alone. Quite simply, Handbook of the Birds of World is the best single reference to birds that I know of, indispensable at the international level, and extremely useful at national and regional levels as well.

The Big Year: A Tale of Man, Nature and Fowl Obsession by Mark Obmascik [2004]. Free Press. $37.50 CAN (hardcover) ISBN: 0-7432-4545-8. Reviewed by Richard Mooney.

The Big Year is an exciting, stimulating and very enjoyable account of three American birders who compete to see as many bird species as possible in one calendar year. Author Mark Obmascik of Sports Illustrated has captured this adventure in what has become a classic of birding literature. The big year begins, logically, on 1 January 1998 with brash self-made man Sandy Komito beginning his obsessive quest. Quiet, retired, affluent Al Levantin begins his big year in his own patch, high in Colorado, while Greg Miller, a computer specialist wounded from a recent divorce stumbles into his big year which he finances by borrowing from his father and maxing-out credit cards. From Attu, AK, to the Dry Tortugas, FL, these three contend to compile  the best annual list. Mark Obmascik has created a hard-to- put-down adventure of interest to birders and other outdoor  enthusiasts.  1:2 December 2004 94
