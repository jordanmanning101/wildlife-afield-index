If I could, I would drop a ceremonial bottle of champagne against this issue of Wildlife Afield, for this truly is our flagship issue. Contained within these pages is a large part of what the Biodiversity Centre for Wildlife Studies is all about.

Our lead article, by seabird biologist Harry R. Carter, features an historical look at breeding Common Murres on Cleland Island, and provides perspective for understanding how and why birds nested in that location only temporarily. Following, are two articles that address specific conservation issues in British Columbia. First, Joanna Preston reports her findings from a University of Victoria field trip to the South Okanagan Valley. Her study revealed stakeholder opinions regarding a proposed national park for that region, as well as identified the biological shortcomings in targeting politically peripheral species. Second, I provide context for British Columbia’s system of protected areas by reviewing the global protected area network and its effectiveness. The paper reviews such issues of patterns in current conservation effort, specific factors relating to declines in biodiversity and population extinction, and present-day weaknesses in reserve design.

The Notes section contains seven articles ranging from the discovery of a new bird species for British Columbia, to the first documented occurrence of incubation, hatching, and rearing of Western Grebes by Red-necked Grebes in British Columbia. Other topics include an unusual prey item for Gray Wolf, a bizarre bill deformity in the Northern Flicker, and new information on nesting Dusky Flycatchers in the Okanagan Valley.

Our Featured Species for this issue is the wood frog. In this account you will find the latest information on habitat use, annual chronology, and conservation issues, as well as informative tips for identifying the species. The Wildlife Data Centre Report features a large contribution of images for the B C Photo File, a summary of records added to our databases, and a preview into our investigation of observer effort throughout the province. In our Q. & A. section, we discuss two important questions from our readers - the issue of cleaning nestboxes, and tree damage caused by sapsuckers. We close this issue by announcing our 1st Annual General Meeting in Salmon Arm.

I hope you enjoy reading this issue as much as we enjoyed putting it together. In Wildlife Afield 1:1 the ship was built. Now, our sails are set and we’re ready to ride the wind.
