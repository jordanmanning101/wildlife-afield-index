If you’ve been receiving Wildlife Afield since its inception in early 2004, you have no doubt realized a substantial difference in this issue - it is bound differently, and it is much thicker. This is a direct result of the overwhelming support from caring and dedicated naturalists and biologists (from British Columbia, other parts of Canada, and the United States) that have inundated our mail and inboxes with articles, notes, stories, data, and new information, thus allowing us to assemble our biggest issue to date. And we’re not just counting pages! The amount of information on these pages rivals any previous issue, as evidenced in the 

But let’s not jump ahead - it is in fact our lead article by C.G. Bunnell that set this journal into overload. In his Feature Article pertaining to the status, distribution, occurrence and natural history of Red-eared Slider in British Columbia, so much new and valuable information was provided that we had to create our first-ever Wildlife Afield Supplement. These supplements, which are expected to become more common, will be available to members through our website. 

An additional three Feature Articles, more than in any previous issue, cover a broad range of topics including: 1) a review of the origin and status of Pacific Pond Turtle, 2) occurrence and breeding of Sandhill Cranes in the Rocky Mountain Trench, and 3) diet of Great Horned Owls in the Creston Valley. In the Notes section, seven authors share their findings from around British Columbia, including new breeding information for Flammulated Owl, an unusual prey item for Barred Owl, and a summary of Gray Flycatcher breeding in Summerland. Our first “rare species account” on Black-throated Blue Warbler also complements the Notes. In the coming months about 90 of these accounts will form a major part of the Member’s Area on our website. 

This issue also introduces a new section to Wildlife Afield called Species of Regional Significance. The purpose of this section will be to provide information and status updates for species that are regionally significant. Significance will not generally be based  on rarity, but rather on the importance of particular populations, ecological roles, unique habitats, stopover sites, migration routes, and much more. 

And finally, a note of gratitude. The production of Wildlife Afield requires the support and committment from a lot of different people. We appreciate the quick response to requests for information, especially for photographs, galley proofing, and special efforts to help make the articles more complete (e.g., Dr. Fred Zwickel drove from Cortes Island to hand deliver new information and images for the Turkey Vulture account). Lastly, proofing Wildlife Afield is often a difficult and thankless job; we thank Joanna Preston for her comments that have helped make each issue a better product. 

I hope you enjoy reading this issue. It truly is, A Turn of the Times.

From one editor to another: Upon receiving a copy of Wildlife Afield Anna Leighton, editor of Blue Jay published by the Saskatchewan Natural History Society, wrote “What an excellent publication, one that holds a lot of promise aswell. Interesting articles, well written and illustrated and great variety. The Biodiversity Centre sounds like a tremendous initiative and coupled with the magazine, a great way to collect and manage records, educate, inspire and inform. A lot of work, however, and I wish you great success”.
