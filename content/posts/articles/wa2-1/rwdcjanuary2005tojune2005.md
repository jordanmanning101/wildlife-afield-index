### Manager’s Message  

The first half of 2005 was very busy. In the 50-year history of the British Columbia Nest Record Scheme (BCNRS), 2004 marked the best ever. Over 27,600 nest cards of 266 species were compiled through much of January, February, and March (Figure 1); nearly 7,000 were from the 2004 breeding season. The BCNRS is the largest and most active nest record scheme in North America, and to celebrate this achievement, we are currently working on a special 50-year anniversary issue that reviews its entire history. The report will include species summaries, provincial coverage, and volunteer effort (Figure 2). We anticipate completion of the report by year-end.

Our next project was the updating of British Columbia’s official species list. Since the last report, published in 1997, numerous changes have occurred. These include new species additions, changes in species names, and a re-ordering of some species or families based on new taxonomic information. With the list now complete, copies of the report can be purchased directly from us, or ordered on-line through our website at www.wildlifebc.org. 

In February, Lloyd F. Kiff, an internationally recognized ornithologist and past Director of the Western Foundation of Vertebrate Zoology in Los Angeles, CA, met with us in Deep Bay to discuss and examine our electronic databases. When Lloyd returned home to Idaho, where he presently serves as Science Director of The Peregrine Fund (World Center for Birds of Prey), he wrote “... I was absolutely dazzled by your enormous database. I am unaware of any similar project of this magnitude, and detail, and it seems to me that you are again ahead of the curve.” Thanks Lloyd. We appreciate your support and kind words.  

Among our rapidly growing list of members throughout the province, we are pleased to see various organizations, libraries, schools, businesses, and out-of-province people join our society. For example, Dr. Francis R. Cook, a retired  herpetologist and present editor of The Canadian Field- Naturalist, recommended to the Canadian Museum of Nature  in Ottawa, that Wildlife Afield be deposited in their library. Thanks also to the Williams Lake Field Naturalists, the Sunshine Coast Natural History Society, the Lillooet Field Naturalist Society, the Friends of Semiahmoo Bay Society, and the Creston Valley Wildlife Management Authority, for adding our journal to their libraries. 

Our final piece of news for this period is the addition of papers published in Wildlife Afield being bibliographed by the Ornithological Worldwide Literature (OWL). Beginning in late June, all Feature Articles, Notes, and Featured Species pertaining to birds will be searchable on the OWL website at http://egizoosrv.zoo.ox.ac.uk/owl. This will be of considerable importance to researchers throughout the world as it is often difficult to find papers published in regional journals such as ours.  

### Website Update  

This section will be a regular addition to the “Report of the Wildlife Data Centre”. It will highlight new information, products, and downloads available through our website. In this first report, please refer to From the Editor on page 2 to read about the launch of our website. 

### Praise for Wildlife Afield 

When we started Wildlife Afield we didn’t know just how much the journal would affect people concerned about wildlife and their habitats in British Columbia. We knew we were filling a gap by illuminating conservation issues and providing articles, notes, and species profiles based on data; but we didn’t expect such a resounding element of praise. We are pleased to be able to fill this important niche and are encouraged by your positive feedback. Below are just a few of the comments our members have made about Wildlife Afield. Thank you to all - we will continue to strive to provide the quality and content you have come to expect. 

Jim Anderson (Toronto, ON): A retired biologist, Jim said: “Finally a provincial biodiversity journal in Canada that everyone can understand and enjoy and put together with passion and expertise! What separates your group from all others is your impressive electronic and hard copy collections. The future looks bright for wildlife in BC. Well Done!” He also mentioned that the article on “peripheral species” by Joanna Preston was timely, given the recent interest in endangered species and the need to encourage the governments development of new programs to rethink how to spend precious money and resources. 

Dr. Francis R. Cook (North Augusta, ON): In a letter to Wayne Campbell, Francis said: “...Thanks also for the copy of Wildlife Afield 1(2) with the feature account of the Wood Frog and the note on Bullfrog predation. The Wood Frog account appears to be well documented...the Bullfrog food list for B. C. is most impressive...I am to no end impressed with what you are putting together. How far we have come since the 1950s when I got started...” 

Sherry Lidstone (McLure, BC): After receiving Wildlife Afield [Vol. 1, No. 2], Sherry sent Linda Van Damme the following note: “... I was pretty much floating on air when my husband brought it home & we opened it! I am really pleased that my drawingsturned outso well, they almost look like they were drawn by hand on the page. I am more thrilled with the results & the journal as a whole is fantastic!” 

Len Jellicoe (Surrey, BC): In an e-mail to the editor, Len states: “I enjoyed the last copy of Wildlife Afield: especially your picture of the Grizzly. Your heart must have been thumping even though you were in your vehicle. That is a shot of a lifetime.” 

David Stirling (Victoria, BC): David offered his congratulations “...on just a tremendous job! The new issue has a nice format, is easy to read and accurate.” He appreciated the articles by Mike and Joanna Preston and echoed Jim Anderson’s comments on the use of government resources on peripheral species when funds are short. 

Cyril Colonel (Creston, BC): “Well, you have done it again. Received the last Wildlife Afield and it is pretty hard to come up with words to describe it other than being sensational. I remember Bill Vanderzam using the words Super Natural British Columbia a lot and Super Natural Wildlife Afield would probably fit the description well. What is so important is there is something for everyone. Good for all of you. I’m pretty much through the publication and am anxiously awaiting the next one. Seems like a long time between issues.” 

Larry Halverson (Radium, BC): Larry sent an e-mail that read: “Just picked up the mail – WOW! What a nice publication. Looking forward to sitting by the fire tonight and reading it from cover to cover.”  

Douglas Leighton (Blaeberry, BC): An e-mail to the editor read: “Thanks for sending me a copy of Wildlife Afield. Very refreshing, interesting, and diverse. J. Preston’s article raised some very important questions about priorities that seem to have been ignored of late. Will be happy to support this venture and will send a cheque next time we get to town.” 

Sylvia Pincott (Pender Island, BC): “Congratulations and best wishes on the huge project you have taken on. We are thankful for what you are achieving and will very much look forward to the next issue of Wildlife Afield. Well done!” 

Ivar Nygaard-Petersen (Powell River, BC): “The number 2 journal was a good one! With everything said and done, you [editor] must be burning the midnight oil with work on the journal and everything else that you are doing. It is very much appreciated.” 

Tom Rivest (Port Hardy, BC): “...this is the kind of journal BC needs to connect all the wildlife biologists like me who live and work 50 miles from town. Keep up the good work!”  

### Database Update  

The first half of 2005 was a great start to another year of data entry. For the period, 283,564 records were added to our electronic databases. Most of these were birds (275,994), although respectable numbers of reptiles and amphibians (2,579) and mammals (4,991) were also added. 

Bird additions were comprised of 270 species from 1,507 different locations. Over 1,000 new occurrence records were added for 44 of these locations, including such places as Summerland (7,170), Revelstoke (6,818), Fauquier (4,104), Riske Creek (2,902), Qualicum Beach (1,949), Williams Lake (1,821), Bridesville (1,497), Fort St. James (1,300), and Haney (1,214). Over 10,000 records were added for each of Barn Swallow (89,889), Eastern Kingbird (16,208), American Kestrel (15,191), and Rufous Hummingbird (13,749). An additional 14 species had between 1,000 and 10,000 new occurrence records added, including Varied Thrush (5,393), Barred Owl (3,104), Killdeer (1,521), and Sharp-tailed Grouse (1,030; Figure 3). 

New occurrence records for mammals comprised 48 species. American beaver (879) had the greatest number of new records, followed by woodchuck (665), red squirrel (625), and little brown bat (398). New reptile and amphibian records comprised 9 species, with Columbia spotted frog leading the way with 1,066 new records, followed by western toad with 351 records.

### Database Totals for Select Bird Species 

With our bird databases fast approaching 5 million records it seemed like an appropriate time to look at a sample of the total number of records that have been amassed for a few species. They are grouped into broad status categories to give a more provincial sense of the size of each database. We compared these totals with numbers of records used to write The Birds of British Columbia (BBC) with those presently in the Wildlife Data Centre (WDC) files to emphasize the growing increase in available information that will ultimately  contribute to more informed decisions about birds in the province. 

Table 1 shows the dramatic increase in records for each listed species and is indicative for most species of vertebrates in our databases. The task of keeping up with the inflow of current data, while at the same time entering historical information is overwhelming, but we are making excellent progress. The growing databases will allow us to examine with more confidence provincial trends, expansion and contraction in ranges over the past 118 years, changes in early and late arrival and departure dates and breeding chronology provincially and regionally, coexistence and competition among species, and regional habitat requirements for all species at each season. 

Numbers for the Red-tailed Hawk (Figure 4), a resident species across southern British Columbia, were derived from daily field observations of intense research by graduate students (e.g., Craig Runyan in Pitt Meadows), falconers (e.g., Frank L. Beebe, Brian Davies, Neil Trenholme, Colin Trefry, and Martin C. Lee), organized raptor surveys (e.g., Lower Mainland, Creston Valley, and Rose Hill), raptor migration watches (e.g., West and East Kootenay, East Sooke Park, Douglas Plateau, and northern Okanagan Valley), hundreds of roadside raptor surveys conducted throughout the province since 1965, species summaries in naturalists’ journals (e.g., Martin W. Holdom, Derek Beacham, Theed Pearse, Maurice Ellison, Gary S. Davidson, and Chris Siddle), annual bird reports (Victoria and Vancouver), birds of prey summaries in consultant reports, highway raptor mortality surveys (e.g., central Fraser River valley and southeastern Vancouver Island), and general observations submitted by supportive birdwatchers.

The Sharp-tailed Grouse data was mostly extracted from historical summary reports of biologists Ralph W. Ritcey and Patrick W. Martin working in the Kamloops region. Fortunately, they had also summarized additional information for the Cariboo-Chilcotin and Peace River regions. 

Nonbreeding migrants, mainly shorebirds, showed some of the smallest increases since most have such a narrow window in which they can be observed. The importance of a centralized database was recognized recently when shorebird species richness and diversity was being compiled for the protection of all estuaries on Vancouver Island. 

The impressive Rufous Hummingbird totals are a direct result of a huge interest in watching hummingbirds by the general public and our programs to encourage recording of common species. It is likely, that once analyzed, the data will show this species is arriving earlier and staying later in British Columbia than it was 50 years ago. The size of the Pacific-slope (Western) Flycatcher database was surprising. The daily field notes of long-time naturalists, including J.E. Victor Goodwill, Adrian Dorst, A.R. Davidson, John Comer,  Dennis Horwood, Doug and Marian Innes, Glenn R. Ryder, Martin W. Holdom, Mark Hobson, Theed Pearse, Ken C. Boyce, Chris Siddle, Barbara Sedgwick, and David Stirling provided a substantial portion of the total, as did annual summer forest bird surveys conducted over the past eight years in coast forests. Additional observations were extracted from annual bird reports for Victoria and Vancouver as well as the field diaries of forest and seabird biologists working along the coast often in dense mixed coniferous forests that the species favours. Biologist Michael S. Rodway was a prime source. 

The interest in rare and peripheral species, often at the detriment of endemic and vulnerable species, continues although there is some encouraging recent move towards ecosystem representation. Most of the recent records added to our databases for species with restricted ranges, such as Connecticut Warbler and Sage Thrasher, comes from extensive field work being carried out in the Peace River and Okanagan Valley regions respectively, and the discovery of historical records in diaries and notebooks. 

Since it was first recorded in British Columbia in 1943 the Barred Owl has spread throughout the boreal forest and continued its invasion south through western North America to northern California. During its 61 years in the province it has now become one of the most often heard and seen owls - and our database shows it. Of the 15 species of owls in British Columbia the Barred Owl is now among our most often reported species and accounts for over 10% of our owl database. To better appreciate the significance of the size of our database a provincial synopsis for Alberta was recently published in the The Canadian Field-Naturalist (Vol. 118:215-224, 2004) entitled The Barred Owl, Strix varia, in Alberta: Distribution and Status. The authors’ comprehensive database, covering the period 1912 through 1999, included a total of 300 individual records. 

The Blue Jay was first reported in British Columbia on 26 December 1948. Over the next 56 years its expansion has almost been as remarkable as the Barred Owl. This eastern invader is now well established and present year-round in the southern Peace River region, and continues to be spotted at new locations in southern regions of the province including Vancouver Island.  

### Digital Domain  

The following story, written by Randy Findlay and reproduced with permission, was extracted from bcvanbirds@yahoogroups.com. 

“Hi All. Had a great couple of hours observing a Northern Pygmy Owl at Maplewood Flats in North Vancouver this morning. A beautiful, quiet and frosty morning at Maplewood. The owl was about 25’ up an alder in the west marsh area to begin with. It was looking pretty twitchy, ie. hungry, so I thought I may be lucky enough to see it after prey. I waited for about an hour and wasn’t disappointed. The bird blasted down out of the tree in front of me and went headlong at full speed into some tall grass and blackberries. After about 3 minutes it laboured into flight with a woodrat in it’s clutches and headed for a bushier tree to dine. I watched from a ways back as it had lunch, and after it had it’s fill it proceeded to stash it’s prey behind some small branches and leaves in the same tree. The rodent fell out once but was quickly replaced. Quite a show from a beautiful, tough little creature!” 

“Away it went to a higher tree again only to be spotted by a couple of “maurading” Black-capped Chickadees. It was trying not to be seen by them, or frighten them, or both, and went into a thin, horned mode [Figure 5]. I’ve never seen anything transform before my eyes like that before...except maybe in a movie. A real spectacle!! Sure was an enjoyable morning of birding.”  

### BC Photo File for Wildlife Records 

The need to document the occurrence of unusual occurrences was first proposed by R. Wayne Campbell and David Stirling in a paper “A Photoduplicate File for British Columbia Vertebrate Records” published in 1971 in the scientific journal Syesis (4:217-222). Over the years the file has grown to include photo-documentation of wildlife behaviour, mortality, rare and sensitive habitats, nest sites (especially raptors), strandings, unusual plumages, aberrant growths and deformities, predation, and similar topics. During the 34 years the photo-file has been in existence, over 3,200 images have been catalogued - almost 100 per year. 

The provincial photo-file, like a museum collection of skins and eggs, serves as a scientific and reference repository for documenting noteworthy and unusual events for wildlife in British Columbia. Images cannot be reproduced without the individual photographer’s permission. For example, Don Roberson, in his book Rare Birds of the West Coast, personally contacted individuals who had submitted photographs to the British Columbia Photo File for permission to publish their images. And most agreed (e.g., Tufted Duck, 14 October 1967 at Lost Lagoon, Vancouver by Lothar Kirchner, Ross’s Gull, 9 November 1966 at Clover Point, Victoria by Ralph Fryer, and Blue-gray Gnatcatcher, 10-11 November 1963 at Victoria by G. Allen Poynter). All photographers agree, however, individual records can be used for conservation and education purposes such as preparing checklists, web page summaries, and public lectures. 

The entire photo-file, organized by species, will eventually be available on our website www.wildlifebc.org. Already, a sample of the catalogue for Loons and Grebes is available for preview. 

A total of 67 new photographs were catalogued and added to the provincial photo file. Some noteworthy images included: Green Turtle (casual in BC, Green Point - Peter Clarkson), Rough-legged Hawk (bill deformity, North Delta - Len Jellicoe; see page 40), Harlequin Duck (nest site, East Kaipit Creek – Wayne Matkoski), Great Horned Owl (urban nesting, Victoria - John McKay), Wandering Salamander (first occurrence for Gulf Islands - Christian Groneau), Band-tailed Pigeon (rare inland occurrence, Princeton - Jack Lay), Long-billed Curlew (rare on BC coast, Chesterman Beach - Adrian Dorst; Figure 6), Mew Gull (nesting colony, Quatse Lake – Michael S. Rodway), Peregrine Falcon (nest site, Galiano Island - Harry R. Carter), Glaucous-winged Gull (beak deformity, Clover Point - R. Wayne Campbell; see Page 40), Eastern Phoebe (nesting, Goodlow - Hanna Emes), Snow Bunting (rare occurrence, Nelson - Rita Wege), Herring Gull (nesting colony, Ellis Island - R. Wayne Campbell), Great Horned Owl (unusual mortality, Creston Valley - Linda M. Van Damme; Figure 7), Snowy Owl (unusual number, Delta - Walter Ammann), Brown Creeper (early nesting, Patricia Bay - W.L. Taylor), Boreal Owl (rare on the southwest coast, Reifel Island - Dave Dranchuck), White-throated Sparrow (rare on Vancouver Island - R. Wayne Campbell), Common Loon (early nest, Vaseux Lake - S.J. Darcus), Barred Owl (Coquitlam - David C. Schutz), and Pinyon Jay (first BC record, Lister - Malcolm Dennington: see page 16).  

### Field Notes The “Goodwill” Model for Biologists and Naturalists 

Taking notes in the field is a personal decision that varies considerably among people. Documentation of animals range from writing a simple list of species to adding the numbers, sexes, and perhaps what the animal was actually doing to finally reaching the pinnacle of commitment by documenting everything you see. Vic Goodwill went through all of these stages starting in 1929 in Ontario. He quickly realized that his careful observations of wildlife could benefit ornithologists in their constant battle to protect animals and the places they inhabit. He was told early that “knowledge is power” and you “can never go back in time to recover what you have seen so make the most of your time afield”. 

By the time Vic reached British Columbia in 1966 he was already extremely well organized in his note-taking. The late W. Earl Godfrey, curator of ornithology at the National Museum of Canada, wrote “... I do not know of any professional or amateur ornithologist in Canada who is so meticulous and thorough in documenting birds and other wildlife. Mr. Goodwill has been among the most reliable and conscientious contributors to The Birds of Canada.” 

Vic started off by keeping annual lists of birds seen by date in small 2.5 x 5.5 inch notebooks. Soon afterwards he realized that he was seeing more than what he was recording and that the extra information might be useful someday. He made a decision early to be more precise and thorough in recording what he observed and graduated to what would become an obsession as well as a passion. He had a special “note-taking platform” built inside his car and began recording field notes on 8.5 x 11 inch lined paper. He recorded all of the important information, including observer(s), mileage (to within 0.1 km) and precise route information, 1:50,000 NTS map grids, weather, species, number, sex, behaviour, habitat, breeding, and anything else he thought was significant. When he returned to Victoria from a long birding trip or home from a local trip he summarized the information into monthly packages. Much of this was completed while listening to baseball and football games on television. 

Each monthly summary started with a hard cover calendar with hand drawn 1-inch day grids (see Wildlife Afield 1:1, page 31) that included a brief notation of where he went, along with noteworthy celestial information such as a full moon. This was followed by a monthly summary of all species seen. For example, in February 1994 he saw 105 species of which Tufted Duck, Lincoln’s Sparrow, “Eurasian” Green-winged Teal, “Black” Brant, Cedar Waxwing, Glaucous Gull, White-throated Sparrow, Common [Wilson’s] Snipe, Tree Swallow, and Cassin’s Auklet were underlined and new for the year. The bulk of his monthly reporting included very detailed notes that averaged over 120 pages per month. Finally, everything he tallied to date for the year was summarized on a bird checklist at the end of each month. A typical entry from 1 of 12 pages written on 10 May 1992 from the “Goodwill” Model on a trip along Highway 5A from Merritt to Kamloops is shown on Page 38. We have provided a typed version of these notes, although they are all hand-written on lined paper. 

Vic also knew the importance of documenting rare or unusual sightings with additional notes made on the spot. His field notes could be a single line such as “21 July 1988, Clover Point, 1 Little Gull, adult with black head and no black in wing tips, 07:24 hrs, asleep among Bonaparte’s Gulls on kelp bed close to E-ward”. Often, a far more detailed description was given for birds new to his life list. 

As a married man Vic knew he was very fortunate to have the unconditional support of his wife Peggy who often shared birding excursions (Figure 8) and more importantly appreciated the significance of the contributions Vic was making to ornithology and conservation. 

Vic’s life work was willed to the Wildlife Date Centre in trust of Wayne Campbell. His collection of field notes occupies 4.9 metres (16.3 feet) of library shelf space with an estimated 625,000 individual records of birds, mammals, and reptiles. The task of entering his data electronically and transferring breeding records to nest cards has already started. 

The Biodiversity Centre for Wildlife Studies has an enormous responsibility to Vic (and to wildlife in the province) to properly archive and maintain the integrity of his collection. They also must quickly incorporate his notes into their master databases so his information can be put into perspective provincially. Since Vic was so committed to record everything he saw daily, his information will have significant value for future analyses of interpreting trends for common species like Barn Swallow, Bald Eagle, and even Glaucous-winged Gull. Vic’s field notes are the most significant collection of observations ever assembled in British Columbia.  

We cannot imagine the “treasures” that will be discovered and how the collection can be used in the future. A recent paper published in the scientific journal Wilson Bulletin (116:224:- 231) entitled “Climate change as reflected in a naturalist’s diary, Middleborough, Massachusetts” demonstrates some of the potential. By analyzing a naturalist’s daily records of arrival and departure for 32 continuous years it was shown that some birds are arriving significantly earlier than they did just 30 years ago. 

Vic Goodwill has set very high standards for note-taking and it is doubtful many biologists and naturalists will follow his model. We can, however, glean some segments and ideas to enhance our own recordings.

### The British Columbia Wildlife Records Committee 

The task of maintaining the integrity of our databases is a very high priority. Every record that we receive is critically reviewed assuring a professional level of quality control. Questionable information is followed up with e-mails, letters, or telephone calls. For some records, we require professional review in the form of written documentation. In many cases such a review involves examination of photographic evidence. This becomes especially important when species are being added to British Columbia lists. 

As of 1 May 2005, the Biodiversity Centre for Wildlife Studies has formally established a provincial wildlife records committee that presently includes insects (butterflies), amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. The chairperson for each committee is listed on the inside back cover of Wildlife Afield and on our web page. The representative for each wildlife group will be responsible for contacting at least two “experts” for external review. Then, all reviewers and the chairperson must accept the record before it is added to our databases and our provincial lists. 

Editor’s Note: The Pinyon Jay, the first record to be officially reviewed by the British Columbia Wildlife Records Committee, has been accepted and added to the list of birds known to occur in the province. 

### Education and Extension 

Our most effective means of making information available is to present it personally, since the opportunity affords the luxury of providing background information, photographs, various figures, and detailed explanations of results. The key to public lectures, however, is being able to respond directly to questions from audience participants. In the first half of 2005 eight lectures were presented. 

In Port McNeill, at a Public Advisory meeting for Weyerhaeuser, preliminary results of systematic bird surveys for all of Vancouver Island were presented together with the context of incidental observations housed by the Wildlife Data Centre. The meeting was a huge success with some participants joining the Biodiversity Centre for Wildlife Studies, some agreeing to record their incidental observations, and one, Megan Hanacek, volunteering to be a Regional Coordinator for the Port Hardy/Port McNeill region. 

In Invermere, during the Wings Over the Rockies festival, two owl lectures were presented to children in Grades 3 and 4. Here, it was hard to determine who was more excited about breaking open owl pellets, us or them! Two additional lectures were also provided. Wayne Campbell  gave an evening lecture entitled No More Myths, which is aimed at clearing many of the misnomers about bird biology and natural history. Michael Preston then gave a follow-up wildlife workshop which included a 2-hour lecture on “how and what” to record while in the field, as well as a field trip to put what had been learned into practice. Field-trip participants were delighted to learn just how much there was to see; participants Rita Wege and Larry Prosser were eager to start a new era of wildlife watching and note-taking for themselves. 

In Golden, at the Spring to Life festival, Wayne and Michael gave the same lectures as in Invermere. The field trip, which included a local survey of Reflection Lake resulting in 24 species of marsh birds, inspired several participants to start recording their own observations for later donation to the Wildlife Data Centre. Bob Ferguson, a wildlife biologist living just south of Golden, and a field-trip participant, invited us back to his place where we were treated to a spectacular garden for the birds. From Western Tanagers and MacGillivray’s Warblers bathing in his pond, to Turkey Vultures and a Northern Goshawk soaring overhead, Bob’s place was certainly enviable. Perhaps Bob’s greatest treat was when he showed us a Barn Owl that he had collected as a roadside mortality not far from his home (Figure 9).

In Chetwynd, a lecture on wildlife-forest interactions, politically peripheral species, and the Wildlife Data Centre was presented at a Public Advisory meeting for Canfor. Participants were surprised to learn just how much information was available for “rare” species. 

### Wildlife Alert - Request for Assistance 

**Wildlife Deformities** 

Sherry Lidstone’s detailed article in the last issue of Wildlife Afield (1:62-64) highlights the importance of recording deformities in wildlife that may be caused by physiological or environmental conditions. Recently a growing number of people have been reporting an alarming increase in abnormalities in the bills and feet of many birds. It appears that both land birds and seabirds are being affected. The most puzzling situation was discovered locally in Alaska from the vicinity of the Matanuska-Sustina Valley, Anchorage, and Eagle River. Starting in the mid-1990s  biologist Colleen Handel compiled 692 reports of Black- capped Chickadees with very elongated bills and has  recorded deformities for 25 species of birds throughout Alaska. The cause(s) of the deformities is not known but birds are being analyzed for diseases, genetic abnormalities, and environmental pollutants. 

Closer to home The Falcon Research Group in Seattle recently reported that since 1997 they have discovered 60 raptors (55 Red-tailed Hawks, 2 Rough-legged Hawks, 2  Peregrine Falcons, and 1 Ferruginous Hawk) with “long- bills” mostly found along the entire Pacific coast. In British  Columbia, some of these abnormalities are being reported to the Wildlife Data Centre (Figure 10 and 11).  

YOU CAN HELP! Look closely at birds visiting your feeders, carefully scan loafing and roosting seabirds, closely examine birds being banded, and generally be aware of our concern when examining bird nests and broods. Document details for each observation (e.g., date, place, time, species, behaviour, etc.) including your name and address as well as a sketch of the abnormality and send it to us. Also helpful would be to record the total number of “normal” birds of the same species that were seen in the area. Ideally, a photograph would be preferred as these can be added to the provincial BC Photo File for Wildlife Records. Mammals, reptiles, and amphibians should also be considered. 

At present our databases contain reports of deformities for over 20 species of wildlife in the province with Northwestern Crow having the highest incidence. 

**Barn Swallow** 

As time permits we are putting a huge effort into compiling and electronically entering historical and current records of the occurrence for the Barn Swallow in the province. We estimate that close to 120,000 records will have been entered by the end of the year. Once completed, British Columbia will be in a unique position to analyze year-round information on regional trends in numbers, the effect of global warming and climate change on Barn Swallows, breeding success regionally and over a period of time, changes in arrival and departure dates, changes in nesting sites over the past 118 years, and make informed recommendations for provincial listing and mitigation. It is an enormous and challenging undertaking but we have a lot of member support and an excellent start. 

In the meantime, any historical observations, including nests with nestlings or nests that had recently fledged young, would be welcome. Especially important are observations of arrival and departure dates for different areas and elevations of the province over time. Details can be sent directly to the Wildlife Data Centre. A more comprehensive report summarizing the 2004 nesting season is presented in the 50th Annual Report of the British Columbia Nest Record Scheme (see Biodiversity Centre for Wildlife Report No. 3, 2005). 

### Contributions, Gifts, and Donations 

As the concept of a provincial Wildlife Data Centre becomes more accepted individuals, organizations, and industry are beginning to appreciate the significance of having a centralized source for wildlife information. The effectiveness and impacts of our activities and projects for wildlife of course depend on our hard copy and electronic collections. We are therefore grateful to the following people for their thoughtfulness and support in donating field notes, field observations, books, reports, and other miscellaneous items. 

David Stirling (Victoria): A diverse collection of reports, papers and reprints on British Columbia wildlife dating back to 1909, mimeographed lecture notes on biogeography by the late Dr. Miklos D.F. Udvardy, 1960 and 1970 issues of The Murrelet [the journal of the Pacific Northwest Bird and Mammal Society], and original miscellaneous field notes of the late Theed Pearse (Comox) for 1940 to 1957. The latter includes early visits to the seabird colony on Mitlenatch Island. 

Holly Middleton (Port Moody): Sixty-six nest records in 2003-2004, and 35 nest records from 2005, from her Masters research on American Dipper in the Chilliwack River watershed (Figure 12). An additional 130 nest records of 32 other species were donated for the same area. 

Margaret (Peggy) E. Goodwill (Victoria): Two crammed, legal-sized filing cabinets as well as many boxes of daily field notes on wildlife observations in North America by the late J. E. Victor Goodwill. Another filing cabinet contained a complete and neatly folded set of indexed marine charts and topographical maps for British Columbia and other localities he visited in North America. See page 36 for more details.  

Glenn R. Ryder (Aldergrove): Detailed personal field notes totaling 194 pages covering 150 Mile House, Gravel Lake, Beaver Lake, Stum Lake, White Pelican Park, Lac la Hache, Alexis Creek, Siwash Lake, Lava Canyon, Kleena Kleene, and Palmer Lake from 7 June through 19 August 1974. An additional 123 pages of miscellaneous notes were obtained for regions in the lower Fraser River valley between 1955 and 2004. 

Linda M. Van Damme (Creston): A stack of Columbia Basin Fish & Wildlife Compensation Program reports, a rare copy of Mountain Beavers in the Pacific Northwest (published in 1929 by the US Department of Agriculture and sold for 5 cents!), and a copy of her field notes through 2004. A complete set of Linda’s notes, that spans 26 years (1979- 2004), has now been deposited in the Wildlife Data Centre library as an “insurance” copy. The collection takes up over five feet of space. 

Fred L. Bunnell (Surrey): Undergraduate student papers (many of which are only a few steps away from publication) and original daily field notes of Glenn R. Ryder for the period 12 May through 19 June 1978 while he was employed by Fred at Stum Lake assisting with field studies of the American White Pelican. 

Eileen C. Campbell (Saanich): Notebooks containing over 4,800 detailed observations of birds and mammals recorded daily in her backyard near Cadboro Bay on southern Vancouver Island in 2004. Highlights included arrival and departure dates for migrants, fluctuations in winter populations, songbird predation, and an over-wintering Hermit Thrush, Ruby-crowned Kinglet, Lincoln’s Sparrow, White-throated Sparrow, and three different races of Fox Sparrows. 

Mark Hobson (Tofino): Notebook No. 22 arrived in April and covered the first part of 2005 for wildlife encountered in the Tofino area. 

Creston Field Naturalists: Organized bird counts containing 4,904 records (1999 to 2004) and Christmas Bird Count data comprising 1,383 records (1999 to 2004), were compiled and donated by Sheila Reynolds. 

### Questions and Answers  

The Wildlife Data Centre receives many e-mails, letters, faxes, and telephone calls requesting information to clarify some issue concerning wildlife. Using our databases and  library we try to answer these questions with information- based facts. Some answers that require research may be of  interest to our members. 

Q1: In late October 2004 Glen McInnes’ daughter and her husband brought two bird nests attached to small branches they found on trees that had to be removed in Mission and Surrey. Glen identified the nests as those of a Bushtit (Figure 13). In November, when the leaves were off the trees, Glen and his wife searched for similar nests near the Stave River. He found a couple and did not want to disturb the nests if the birds come back next year to use the same nest. He wrote:... My question for you is will they [Bushtits] come back next year and use the same nest? 

A1: Re-use of nests depends on how rapidly they deteriorate from year-to-year. In Iowa, H. E. McClure studied the over-winter survival of 489 bird nests for nine different species and found that nests of the American Robin, Baltimore Oriole, and Mourning Dove survived the winter best. Each of these nests is quite durable unlike the nests of most ground-nesting species and many small songbirds that nest in bushes. It is known that some species have used nests for many years in a row without material additions while others simply revamp nests each year. In Pennsylvania, a Mourning Dove used the same nest for nine consecutive years before it fell. It is well known that Barn Swallows are faithful to a nest site and return each year to add to their nests. Like rings in a tree, the different coloured nest layers each year gives an accurate total for the number of years the swallows have used the nest. In British Columbia, the total is seven consecutive years for a nest at Burnaby Lake.  

As might be expected, nest reuse is more uncommon among songbirds than non-passerine species. We know that eagles, some hawks, and Ospreys return each year to refurbish their nest. In the Peace River region of British  Columbia, a pair of Golden Eagles has used the same cliff- nesting site for 32 consecutive years. Today, the stick nest is  estimated to stand nearly nine feet tall. 

But back to Bushtits. We checked the Wildlife Data Centre databases and learned that this diminutive passerine will reuse nests from year-to-year. There are instances reported for Victoria, Langley, Nanaimo, Burnaby, and Aldergrove. Three consecutive years is the maximum for one nest and interestingly each reuse of a particular nest was preceded by a mild winter and current dry spring. So, it is likely that Bushtit nests can be reused; but if not, some small mammals have been known to use them during severe winters. Old Bushtit nests, if not reused, may also provide a source of nesting material for Swainson’s Thrushes, American Robins and Winter Wrens.
