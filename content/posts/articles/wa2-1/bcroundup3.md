### News of Friends 

Cyril Colonel: In 2004 Cyril entered the Creston Valley Chamber of Commerce photo contest and was awarded first and third prize. His photo “canola fields” was used on the front cover of Experience the Beautiful Creston Valley issued by the town of Creston. The Kootenay farmer was also busy spreading the word on the impact and prevention of baling twine fatalities to nesting Ospreys. He published an article in the February 2005 issue of Country Life in BC entitled “All caught up.” 

Spencer G. Sealy: Professor Sealy (Figure 14) became the first Canadian editor of the prestigious scientific journal The Auk that is dedicated to the scientific study of birds and their environments. It is published by the American Ornithologists’ Union. Spencer attended the University of  Alberta, University of British Columbia, and received his doctorate from the University of Michigan before joining the University of Manitoba in 1972. He has published extensively on the marine ecology of seabirds and avian brood parasitism. He was recognized recently by his peers for outstanding contributions to ornithology in Canada by the Society of Canadian Ornithologists/Société des Ornithologistes du Canada in 2004 and in January 2005 with the Lifetime Achievement Award of the Pacific Seabird Group for original contributions to knowledge and conservation of seabirds in the northeastern Pacific Ocean. 

Gary S. Davidson: After leaving us in early February 2004 for a year-long teaching exchange in Tasmania Gary returned home to life in Nakusp in January 2005. He found  165 new species of birds including the Tasmanian Native- Hen that is one of the island’s 12 endemics.  

Fran Kimpton: Fran is “putting down her pen” after 17 years of writing the column Nature Notes for the Valley Echo newspaper that covers the East Kootenay region of British Columbia. Her writings have been a source of information and inspiration for many naturalists and wildlife lovers. Many of her notes contained details of sightings and consequently have made their way into publications like The Birds of British Columbia.  

### From the Archives 

140 years ago: David Hunn, writing in the book Our Wildlife Heritage, recounts how Edgar Fawcett, writing about Victoria in the 1800s, made reference to Christmas preparations of those days. Edgar wrote, “Turkey might not have been within their reach, but geese, wild and tame took the place. The Songhee Indians would sell at your door grouse and ducks at 35-50 cents a pair, venison by the quarter at 5 to 8 cents a pound, salmon at 10 cents and oysters for 25 cents a bucket.” 

102 years ago: Collector and naturalist William Spreadborough, travelling through southern British Columbia in 1909, summarized his notes on the Western Lark Finch [Lark Sparrow] as follows: “First seen - two at Myers Creek May 11; common Osoyoos Lake (May 29 - June 7); June 1, found a nest on bare hillside. Nest a slight depression in the ground beneath a small sage bush. Made of weeds and grass and lined with horse hair. Five eggs. Incubation far advanced; common on the Similkameen (June 9 - 13).”

45 years ago: In the 18 April 1960 field notes of Ruth Stirling, from a field trip with Deidre Webb into the Highlands of Greater Victoria to search for the elusive Mountain Quail (Oreortyx pictus), she reported: “Left Victoria 6:45 arrived Munn Road farm [Goodland Farms] approximately 7:15. No sound of quail calling. Generally the hills were very silent, few birds singing with the exception of song sparrows and white-crowned sparrows. Started climbing the hill on the west side of the road at about 8:00am.” 

She continued, “8:40am one calling – “Kyork! Kyork!” repeated at intervals of 2 or 3 seconds. The call came from close at hand and was very different from the California’s “tobacco!” It did not call for very long, about four times in the space of one minute. Silent approach revealed two in a shallow ravine perched on a Douglas fir stump. Ran along ground and up side of ravine, uttering short alarm notes (similar to alarm note of California quail). Chestnut on side and swept back plumes very noticeable. The above two birds were within a few hundred yards of area where first bird called. Had a fleeting glimpse of these birds once again about 150 yards farther on. Vegetation: Few Douglas-fir and small arbutus, moss covered rocks, slash.” 

41 years ago: Andy Andresen, in his egg collection notes at the Western Foundation of Vertebrate Zoology in Los Angeles, CA wrote: “on 27 April 1964 about 400 acres of pasture land near Ladner, BC, were occupied by about 15 pairs of owls [Short-eared Owls]. All stages of young and eggs were found. This set of eight [eggs] ranged from three fresh to a few incubated some days. A sparsely lined hollow on the ground against a bush. Bird flushed.” 

6 years ago: The Peregrine Falcon (Falco peregrinus) was officially removed from the Endangered Species List on 20 August 1999 by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.  

### Final Flight 

Madge Hollington (1914-2004): Madge passed away on 3 September 2004 at the Trail Regional Hospital. 

Although she was born in Calgary, Madge (Figure 15) spent her years growing up in Victoria. She inherited her love of the outdoors from her father who took his young daughter on many a fishing trip. 

She moved to Nelson with her husband Jack in 1945. In those early years they owned no vehicle, but daughter Jeanne recalls that her mother was always interested in the outdoors  and would take the children walking to observe nature and pick huckleberries. 

In 1972, Madge enrolled in a “birding” course taught by Bill Merilees. It was here that she met Hazel Cannings who would become a life-long friend. The enthusiasm of these two women prompted Bill to form the West Kootenay Naturalists’ Association. Madge was proud to be one of the founding members of this organization and remained active until failing health slowed her down. 

Madge was passionate about wild flowers and birds, leading many outings over her long association with the naturalist club and enthusiastically sharing her knowledge. In 1974, along with other interested birders, a winter duck count covering the West Arm of Kootenay Lake was established. This “waterbird” count is still conducted each year and over 25 years of historical data is housed at the Wildlife Data Centre in Victoria. Madge was keen to collect information on birds of the West Kootenay region which she contributed to the four-volume set of The Birds of British Columbia. She served as the regional co-ordinator of the West Kootenay Naturalist Association Christmas Bird Count and annually contributed the results of these counts. When a bluebird nest box trail was established by Stewart Clow in the Castlegar area, she was quick to volunteer with the monitoring. 

Madge took a special interest in monitoring nesting Ospreys along the West Arm of Kootenay Lake submitting her findings to the British Columbia Nest Record Scheme. 

Kathleen Mary Collins (1930-2005): Mary passed away in the Vernon Jubilee Hospital on 26 January 2005. 

Mary was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba and as a young girl moved to the Okanagan Valley where she spent the rest of her life. She became very active as a member and director of the North Okanagan Naturalists Club and participated in many provincial, national, and international wildlife programs. She was a faithful contributor for decades to The Birds of British Columbia project and the BC Nest Record Scheme, carefully documenting birds in the Vernon, Coldstream, and Lavington areas. 

See BC Naturalist (Spring 2005, page 18) for a more detailed account of Mary’s personal life and natural history activities written by Phil Gehlen.  

### Publications of Interest

*Compiled and edited by Chris Siddle*

Field Guide to Bird Nests and Eggs of Alaska’s Coastal Tundra by Timothy D. Bowman. [2004]. 80 pages. 5.5 x 8.5 inches. 450 colour photographs. University of Alaska Fairbanks, P.O. Box 755040, 205 O’Neill Building, Fairbanks, AK 99775-5040. (Softcover: US $25.00). Reviewed by R. Wayne Campbell. 

There are not many books available that deal specifically with the nest and eggs of birds, so any are welcome. This attractive, full-colour volume was prepared to help biologists and others conducting biological research on the coastal tundra of Alaska. It has been designed for use in the field with waterproof pages and a ring binding for easy folding. 

Seventy-one species of tundra-nesting birds are included. Each compact account has coloured photographs of the species (different sexes where applicable), two to four of the nests, and a sample of a single egg at life size accompanied by measurements. For some species (e.g., Canvasback) a  spread museum wing is included to show wing pattern along with samples of contour feathers from the breast. 

The text is brief. A few statements on quick identification of the species as it is flushed, the location and description of its nest and eggs, and some natural history notes round off the maximum 70 or so words of text on each page. The species’ relative abundance in coastal Alaska is listed and finally the average clutch size and typical egg measurements are included with actual size images of an egg. 

As many photographers know, obtaining good photos of the nest and eggs of birds is a real challenge. For the most part, images in the book are good. For some deep nests, however, it would have helped if a light reflector was used to highlight the eggs. 

Unless you are visiting the tundra of coastal Alaska the book has limited use in British Columbia since only 30 of the species breed in our province. I personally found the photographs on contour feathers to be quite helpful since many nests can be positively identified if the female is absent. Because I am an old egg collector I purchased the book for nostalgic reasons alone. 

Birds of the Raincoast: Habits and Habitat by Harvey Thommasen and Kevin Hutchings with R. Wayne Campbell and Mark Hume. [2004]. 222 pages. 8.5 x 11 inches. Harbour Publishing. $44.95 (hardcover). Reviewed by Chris Siddle. 

Birds of the Raincoast is a well written text that covers the birds of British Columbia’s coast east to the Coast Mountains, from estuaries, rivers, fields, farmlands, towns, old-growth and second-growth forests, to the subalpine and the alpine zones. Each of the nine chapters covers one broad habitat, with two other chapters addressing the birds of winter and the birds of the night. The text examines the major (most noticeable) species attracted to each habitat; for example, the chapter entitled River Birds features Common Merganser, Belted Kingfisher, American Dipper, Killdeer, Spotted Sandpiper, Northern Rough-winged Swallow, Vaux’s Swift, Black Swift, and Bald Eagle. Each “key” species has its most common plumages described, and a brief life history given, with emphasis upon observable features like feeding and nesting. Common vocalizations are described phonetically. Frequently if a major writer such as Samuel Taylor Coleridge or John Claire has captured some aspect of a bird in verse, a  brief quotation will be given. Quoted writers include well- known members of Great Britain’s literary tradition, as  well as Canadian and American authors like T.G. Roberts, John Burroughs, and Ralph Waldo Emerson. Canadian folk names for birds are sometimes given, especially when the names capture some characteristic of the bird that the public might notice.

Strategically placed throughout the text are 23 sidebars called “Campbell Facts”. In general these mini-essays by Wayne Campbell stress not trivia but general ornithological truths. Subjects include the re-use of nests, which member of a pair of adults incubate eggs, average lengths of incubation “shifts”, collective nouns for bird flocks, territory sizes, and life expectancy of the Pileated Woodpecker or winter energetics of the Dark-eyed Junco, etc., expanding upon points raised in the main text. 

The text is particularly well written and reads very easily. The content seems generally accurate though a few errors were noted. The Rufous Hummingbird is not the smallest bird in North America (p. 110); the Calliope Hummingbird is several mm smaller. Of the Pileated Woodpecker, it is stated that “an adult can consume up to 2,500 carpenter ants at a single feeding” (p.120). I checked several standard publications on woodpeckers and found the probable source of this “fact” was Bent (1939) who cites a study by F.E.L. Beal (1911) that found “as many as 2,600 ants ... in a single stomach.” (p. 183 in 1964 reprint). Ants in a stomach are just not the same as carpenter ants consumed at a single feeding. The Hairy Woodpecker’s bill is black, not yellowish as stated on page 120. A gull identified as a Herring Gull  eating a starfish (p.32) looks more like a Glaucous-winged x Western hybrid to me. Finally, though not an error so much as a misleading omission, the Brown Creeper shown at the nest (p. 115) should be labeled as a fledgling. 

Photographs of over 100 species of birds grace the pages of this well printed book. Most pages contain one or two crisply reproduced photos. There are also photos of nests, nestlings, habitats, wildflowers and wild berries, as well as photos of about 10 species of wild mammals throughout the book. Almost all of the bird photos are outstanding, so much so that I think this volume is one of the most powerful collections of photographs of British Columbian birds. The vast majority of photos were taken by R. Wayne Campbell and Michael Wigle. Campbell just gets better as a bird photographer with each new publication. Check out his photos of the Gray-crowned Rosy-Finch anting (p.194) or the adult Northern Goshawk tending two chicks at a large messy stick nest (p.117). I was unfamiliar with Wigle’s work but I am now a fan. He is a master of light and colour, using both to evoke mood. My favourite images by Wigle include the American Robin surrounded by fall leaves (p.66), the Common Raven (p.57), and the male Red-winged Blackbird singing in a swamp (p.138). Other contributing photographers include Tim Zurowski, Michael Preston, Mark Nyhof, and Donald E. Waite. 

Even with its occasional shortcomings, I can’t think of a better book for the beginning bird watcher in coastal BC. I wish that I had Birds of the Raincoast back in the early 1960s when I was becoming interested in the birds around my home in Mission; it would have answered many a question I had as a beginner. Birds of the Raincoast has almost everything a person noticing birds for the first time would wonder about, whether it concerns identification, behaviour, feeding, nesting or singing. Highly recommended. 

Editor’s Note: Birds of the Raincoast won the prestigous British Columbia Bookseller’ Choice Award at the province’s annual awards banquet in Vancouver on 23 April 2005. The book was judged the best work published in British Columbia in 2004 based on public appeal, initiative, design, production and content. Congratulations! 

We are also grateful to Harbour Publishing for allowing the Biodiversity Centre for Wildlife Studies to announce their vision in the book in a page entitled Proactive Conservation in British Columbia: The Wildlife Data Centre.
