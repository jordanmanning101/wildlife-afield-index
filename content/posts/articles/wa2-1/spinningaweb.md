Weâ€™ve finally done it! On 1 May 2005, the Biodiversity Centre for Wildlife Studies officially launched its new, long-awaited, website (Figure 1). The announcement was made at the 9th Annual Wings Over the Rockies festival in Invermere, where, after an evening presentation by R. Wayne Campbell, the big surprise was revealed. Our address is: <www.wildlifebc.org>.

Designing and developing the site was no easy task, but thanks to our friends at Reboot Consulting in Victoria, the site came together rather flawlessly. We have integrated a great deal of technology to our site, including such features as e-commerce, flash video, and a secure members area. The website also features an easy to use navigation system that lets the user know their whereabouts at all times.

While there is still much to do on our site, and new information is being posted weekly, first-time visitors will already find a plethora of information. Visitors to the site can get an overview of resources housed by the Wildlife Data Centre, learn about biodiversity and conservation priorities in British Columbia, and view samples of species profiles. For contributors, downloads of observation data sheets, data entry templates, and a data entry instruction manual are available. As well, nest cards can now be ordered simply by sending us an e-mail. Potential new members can view samples of monthly species maps that will only be  available to members, scan the table of contents of our bi- annual journal Wildlife Afield, and download a membership  form or purchase a membership on-line. Additional on- line purchasing will include various publications such as  BC Nest Record Scheme annual reports, provincial and regional checklists, official provincial species lists, wildlife observation instruction manuals, books, and much more.

The latest development on our website is an on-line catalogue of the BC Photo File for Wildlife Records. Web visitors will be able to view all records documented in this file, as well as be able to view a few of the images. While there is still a great deal to be done, the bird file is currently organized by family and has Loons and Grebes complete. Eventually we will have files for mammals, reptiles, amphibians, and butterflies.

I hope you enjoy browsing our website and reading this issue of Wildlife Afield. We are working hard to make information available.
